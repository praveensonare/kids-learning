TOPIC 5: Division Introduction

Theory: Division is sharing equally into groups or grouping into equal sets.

Two Types:
- Sharing: 12 sweets shared between 3 children = 4 each
- Grouping: 12 sweets in groups of 3 = 4 groups

Examples:
- 10 ÷ 2 = 5 (10 shared between 2 = 5 each)
- 15 ÷ 5 = 3 (15 in groups of 5 = 3 groups)
- 20 ÷ 10 = 2
