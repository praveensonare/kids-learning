Nursery Early Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Count objects from 1 to 10 with one-to-one correspondence
- Recognize and write numerals 1-10
- Understand basic concepts of more, less, and same
- Identify and create simple patterns
- Explore shapes and spatial relationships
- Develop mathematical vocabulary and reasoning

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Counting and Number Recognition (1-10)
Theory: Numbers represent quantities. Each number has a symbol (numeral) and a value (how many). Counting involves saying number names in order while matching them to objects.

Examples:
- 1 one sun in the sky
- 2 two hands, two eyes
- 3 three bears (Goldilocks story)
- 4 four wheels on a car
- 5 five fingers on one hand
- 10 ten toes

Worksheets:
1. Count and Circle: Count the objects and circle the correct number (3 apples = circle 3)
2. Number Tracing: Trace numerals 1-5, say the number name
3. Counting Practice: Draw 4 stars, count them, write the number

TOPIC 2: One-to-One Correspondence
Theory: Touching or pointing to each object once while counting ensures accurate counting. This prevents skipping items or counting the same item twice.

Examples:
- Touch each toy car and say "1, 2, 3, 4"
- Give one cookie to each friend at snack time
- Put one sticker on each shape
- Match cups to saucers (one cup for each saucer)

Worksheets:
1. Matching: Draw lines to match each teddy to one bed
2. Counting Dots: Touch each dot with your finger and count aloud
3. Fair Sharing: Draw one ball for each child

TOPIC 3: Number Formation (Writing Numbers)
Theory: Each numeral has a specific way to write it. Starting at the right place and forming numbers correctly helps with legibility.

Examples:
- Number 1: Start at top, straight line down
- Number 2: Around and down, slide right
- Number 3: Around and around (two humps)
- Number 4: Down, across, down
- Number 5: Down, around, hat on top

Worksheets:
1. Skywriting: Trace numbers in the air with big movements
2. Sand Tray: Write numbers in sand with finger
3. Dotted Numbers: Trace numbers 1-10 on dotted lines
4. Rainbow Numbers: Trace number 3 three times with different colors

TOPIC 4: Shapes and Properties
Theory: Shapes have different properties (sides, corners, curves). We can identify shapes by looking at these features.

Examples:
- Circle: round, no corners, no sides (ball, wheel, plate, sun)
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 corners (window, box, sandwich)
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 corners (roof, slice of pizza, mountain)
- Rectangle: 4 sides (2 long, 2 short), 4 corners (door, book, brick)

Worksheets:
1. Shape Hunt: Color all circles red, all squares blue
2. Shape Drawing: Trace and then draw your own circle, square, triangle
3. Shape Sorting: Cut out shapes and group them (all circles together)
4. Shape Pictures: Make a house using shapes (square + triangle = house)

TOPIC 5: Patterns
Theory: Patterns are sequences that repeat in a predictable way. Understanding patterns is fundamental to mathematical thinking and helps children notice order and make predictions.

Examples:
- AB pattern: red-blue-red-blue-red-blue
- ABB pattern: clap-stomp-stomp-clap-stomp-stomp
- ABC pattern: big-medium-small-big-medium-small
- Shape pattern: ○△○△○△

Worksheets:
1. Continue the Pattern: ●○●○●__ (draw ○)
2. Create Your Own: Make a pattern with 2 colors
3. Fix the Mistake: Circle where the pattern is broken
4. Pattern Hunt: Find patterns in the classroom (stripes, tiles)

TOPIC 6: Comparison and Measurement
Theory: We can compare quantities and sizes using mathematical language: more, less, fewer, same, equal, bigger, smaller, taller, shorter, longer, heavier, lighter.

Examples:
- 5 apples is MORE than 3 apples
- The red tower is TALLER than the blue tower
- These two groups have the SAME amount (4 and 4)
- The elephant is BIGGER than the mouse
- My feet are SMALLER than daddy's feet

Worksheets:
1. More or Less: Circle the group with MORE, cross out the group with LESS
2. Same Amount: Draw the SAME number of stars as shown (5 = 5)
3. Size Ordering: Number the bears from smallest (1) to biggest (3)
4. Comparison: Color the longest snake green, shortest snake yellow

TOPIC 7: Positional Language
Theory: Understanding position and direction helps with spatial awareness and following instructions.

Examples:
- The ball is ON the table
- The cat is UNDER the chair
- Stand NEXT TO your friend
- The book is BETWEEN the toys
- Put the teddy INSIDE the box

Worksheets:
1. Position Practice: Color the ball that is ABOVE the box
2. Following Directions: Draw a star ON TOP of the house
3. Where is it?: Circle the toy that is UNDER the table

Sample Activities:
- Counting Songs: "Five Little Ducks," "Ten in the Bed," "Five Currant Buns"
- Number Hunt: Find all the number 3's in the room
- Shape Walk: Go on a walk to find circles, squares, triangles
- Pattern Making: Create patterns with blocks, beads, or stamps
- Snack Math: Count crackers, raisins, or fruit pieces before eating
- Number Line Hopscotch: Jump on numbers 1-10 in order
- Playdough Numbers: Roll and form numbers with playdough
- Size Sorting: Arrange toys/books from smallest to biggest
- Building Towers: Stack blocks and count how many
- Dice Games: Roll dice, count dots, take that many counters

Assessment Ideas:
- Can count to 10 reliably with one-to-one correspondence
- Recognizes numerals 1-10
- Can write numbers 1-5 with correct formation
- Identifies basic 2D shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
- Creates and continues AB patterns
- Uses comparison vocabulary (more, less, bigger, smaller) correctly
- Understands positional language (on, under, next to)
