Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Count reliably up to 10 and beyond
- Recognize and write numerals 0-10
- Understand one-to-one correspondence
- Compare quantities using mathematical language
- Recognize and describe 2D and 3D shapes
- Understand positional language
- Create and continue simple patterns

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Counting to 10
Theory: Counting is the foundation of all mathematics. One-to-one correspondence means matching one number word to one object. The last number counted tells us how many objects there are in total (cardinality).

Counting Principles:
- Point to each object as you count
- Count each object only once
- The order doesn't matter (5 balls is always 5)
- The last number tells the total
- Zero means none or nothing

Examples:
- Count 5 teddy bears: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Count fingers on one hand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Count backward from 5: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off!
- "How many apples?" Point and count: 1, 2, 3 (three apples)

Worksheets:
1. Count and Circle: Count the objects and circle the correct number
2. Dot-to-Dot: Connect dots in number order 1-10
3. How Many: Count objects in each group and write the number
4. Number Hunt: Find and color all the number 3's

TOPIC 2: Number Recognition and Formation
Theory: Numbers are symbols that represent quantities. Each numeral (0, 1, 2, 3...) has a specific name and shape. Learning to recognize and write numbers helps children communicate mathematically.

Number Formation:
- 0: Round circle (zero is nothing)
- 1: Straight down (one line)
- 2: Around and slide (like a swan)
- 3: Around and around (two humps)
- 4: Down, across, down (like a chair)
- 5: Down, around, hat on top

Examples:
- Number 1 looks like a candle
- Number 2 looks like a swan
- Number 3 looks like two bumps
- Find number 5 on a clock
- Write your age using a number

Worksheets:
1. Number Tracing: Trace over dotted numbers 0-10
2. Number Match: Match number to the correct group of objects
3. Number Hunt: Circle all the 4's in the picture
4. Write Numbers: Copy numbers 1-5

TOPIC 3: One More and One Less
Theory: Understanding one more and one less builds number sense. It helps children see relationships between numbers and prepares them for addition and subtraction.

Number Relationships:
- One more than 3 is 4
- One less than 5 is 4
- Numbers go in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Each number is one more than the last
- We can count forwards (more) or backwards (less)

Examples:
- You have 3 cookies, get one more = 4 cookies
- You have 5 balloons, one pops = 4 balloons left
- Number stairs: 1 step up is one more
- Number ladder: climb up (more) or down (less)

Worksheets:
1. Add One More: Draw one more object and count total
2. Take One Away: Cross out one object, count what's left
3. Number Neighbors: Fill in the numbers before and after
4. More or Less: Circle the group with one more

TOPIC 4: Comparing Quantities
Theory: Comparing helps children understand relative size and quantity. We use mathematical language like more, fewer, less, same, equal to describe and compare groups.

Comparison Language:
- More means a bigger amount
- Fewer/Less means a smaller amount
- Same/Equal means the amounts match
- Use words: bigger, smaller, longer, shorter

Examples:
- 5 apples is more than 3 apples
- 2 cars is fewer than 4 cars
- This line of 3 bears is the same as that line of 3 bears
- The red tower is taller than the blue tower

Worksheets:
1. More or Less: Circle the group that has more
2. Same Amount: Draw lines to match equal groups
3. Comparing: Color the set with fewer objects
4. Most and Least: Circle the group with the most

TOPIC 5: 2D and 3D Shapes
Theory: Shapes are all around us. 2D shapes are flat with sides and corners. 3D shapes are solid objects we can hold. Learning about shapes helps children describe and understand the world.

2D Shapes:
- Circle: round, no corners, no straight sides
- Triangle: 3 straight sides, 3 corners
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 corners
- Rectangle: 4 sides (2 long, 2 short), 4 corners

3D Shapes:
- Sphere: ball shape, rolls
- Cube: box with square faces
- Cylinder: tube shape, can roll
- Cone: ice cream cone shape, pointy top

Examples:
- Circle: plate, clock, wheel, pizza
- Square: window, picture frame, cracker
- Sphere: ball, orange, globe
- Cylinder: tin can, paper towel roll

Worksheets:
1. Shape Sort: Group shapes by type (all circles together)
2. Shape Hunt: Find and color all the triangles
3. Shape Trace: Trace around shape templates
4. Real World Shapes: Match shapes to real objects

TOPIC 6: Patterns
Theory: Patterns are things that repeat in a predictable way. Recognizing and creating patterns helps develop logical thinking and mathematical reasoning.

Pattern Types:
- AB pattern: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue
- ABB pattern: star, heart, heart, star, heart, heart
- ABC pattern: circle, square, triangle, circle, square, triangle
- Growing patterns: 1 block, 2 blocks, 3 blocks

Examples:
- Clap, stamp, clap, stamp (AB pattern)
- Big, small, small, big, small, small (ABB pattern)
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (days repeat)
- Stripes on a shirt (color patterns)

Worksheets:
1. Continue the Pattern: What comes next? (circle, square, circle, ?)
2. Create a Pattern: Use stickers to make an AB pattern
3. Pattern Hunt: Find patterns in the classroom
4. Copy the Pattern: Make the same pattern with different colors

TOPIC 7: Positional Language
Theory: Positional language describes where things are in relation to other things. Understanding position words helps children follow directions and describe locations.

Position Words:
- On/Off: teddy is on the chair
- In/Out: ball is in the box
- Under/Over: cat is under the table
- Next to/Beside: book is next to the pencil
- In front/Behind: I'm in front of you
- Top/Bottom: hat on top, shoes on bottom

Examples:
- Put the cup on the table
- The dog is under the bed
- Stand behind your chair
- The star is on top of the tree
- Put your hand in the box

Worksheets:
1. Position Practice: Color the ball that is under the table
2. Follow Directions: Draw a flower next to the house
3. Where Is It: Circle the correct position word
4. Position Pictures: Draw a cat on top of a box

TOPIC 8: Simple Addition (Combining Groups)
Theory: Addition means putting groups together to find how many altogether. At this age, we use objects and pictures to help us count the total.

Adding Concepts:
- Start with one group
- Add another group
- Count all together
- Use fingers, objects, or pictures to help

Examples:
- 2 red cars and 1 blue car = 3 cars altogether
- 3 apples and 2 more apples = 5 apples total
- Hold up 2 fingers, then 3 more fingers = 5 fingers
- "I have 1 cookie, you give me 2 more, now I have 3!"

Worksheets:
1. Count All: Draw 3 stars in one box, 2 stars in another, count total
2. Picture Addition: Circle both groups and write how many altogether
3. Finger Addition: Color fingers to show 2+3
4. Story Problems: "Tom has 2 toys, gets 1 more, how many now?"

TOPIC 9: Simple Subtraction (Taking Away)
Theory: Subtraction means taking some away from a group to find how many are left. We cross out or remove objects to see what remains.

Subtracting Concepts:
- Start with a group
- Take some away (cross out)
- Count what's left
- Use objects or pictures to help

Examples:
- 5 balloons, 2 pop, 3 balloons left
- 4 cookies, eat 1, 3 cookies remain
- 3 birds, 1 flies away, 2 birds left
- Cross out 2 from a group of 5, count what's left (3)

Worksheets:
1. Cross Out: Start with 5 objects, cross out 2, count what's left
2. Take Away Stories: "6 ducks, 2 swim away, how many left?"
3. Picture Subtraction: Color the objects left after some are taken away
4. Before and After: Draw before (5 apples) and after eating 1 (4 apples)

Sample Activities:
- Number Songs: "Five Little Ducks", "Ten in the Bed"
- Counting Games: Count steps, jumps, claps
- Shape Pictures: Make pictures using different shapes
- Pattern Necklaces: Thread beads in patterns
- Number Hunt: Find numbers around the classroom
- Sorting: Sort toys by color, size, or type
- Measuring: Compare who is taller, which is longer
- Building: Use blocks to make patterns and structures
- Number Line Games: Jump along a number line
- Snack Math: Count raisins, share crackers equally
