Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Count, read and write numbers to 100
- Add and subtract one-digit and two-digit numbers to 20
- Understand place value (tens and ones)
- Recognize and name 2D and 3D shapes
- Measure using standard and non-standard units
- Tell time to the hour and half hour
- Solve problems using reasoning

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Number and Place Value to 100
Theory: Our number system is based on place value. Each digit has a value depending on its position. In the number 45, the 4 represents 4 tens (40) and the 5 represents 5 ones.

Counting:
- Count forwards and backwards to 100
- Count in steps of 1, 2, 5, and 10
- Identify one more and one less

Place Value:
- 23 = 2 tens and 3 ones = 20 + 3
- 50 = 5 tens and 0 ones
- 10 ones = 1 ten

Worksheets:
1. Place Value Chart: Write numbers in tens and ones columns
2. Partition Numbers: 47 = ___ tens + ___ ones
3. Number Lines: Fill in missing numbers 34, 35, ___, 37, ___
4. Comparing: Use > < = to compare numbers (45 ___ 54)

TOPIC 2: Addition Within 20
Theory: Addition combines two or more numbers to find the total. We can use number bonds, number lines, or mental strategies.

Mental Strategies:
- Count on from the larger number: 12 + 3 = start at 12, count 13, 14, 15
- Use doubles: 6 + 6 = 12, so 6 + 7 = 13 (one more)
- Make 10 first: 8 + 5 = 8 + 2 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
- Number bonds to 10 and 20

Examples:
- 7 + 8 = 15
- 9 + 9 = 18
- 12 + 5 = 17
- 10 + 10 = 20

Worksheets:
1. Addition Facts: Complete addition grid (+ table to 20)
2. Missing Numbers: 12 + ___ = 19
3. Word Problems: "Anna has 8 apples. Ben gives her 5 more. How many now?"
4. Number Bonds: Show all pairs that make 15

TOPIC 3: Subtraction Within 20
Theory: Subtraction means taking away, finding the difference, or finding a missing part.

Mental Strategies:
- Count back: 15 - 3 = start at 15, count back 14, 13, 12
- Use number bonds: If 8 + 7 = 15, then 15 - 7 = 8
- Find the difference by counting up
- Subtract by taking away

Examples:
- 17 - 5 = 12
- 20 - 11 = 9
- 14 - 6 = 8
- 19 - 9 = 10

Worksheets:
1. Subtraction Practice: 50 subtraction facts within 20
2. Fact Families: 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 5 = 12, 12 - 5 = 7, 12 - 7 = 5
3. Word Problems: "There were 16 birds. 9 flew away. How many left?"
4. Missing Numbers: 18 - ___ = 11

TOPIC 4: Multiplication Introduction
Theory: Multiplication means repeated addition of equal groups. It's a quicker way to add the same number many times.

Skip Counting:
- Count in 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... (pairs)
- Count in 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30... (hands, fingers)
- Count in 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50... (tens)

Equal Groups:
- 3 groups of 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- 4 groups of 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20
- Arrays: rows and columns

Examples:
- "There are 5 boxes. Each box has 2 toys. How many toys altogether?" 
  5 groups of 2 = 10 toys

Worksheets:
1. Skip Counting: Fill in the sequence counting in 2s, 5s, 10s
2. Equal Groups: Draw 4 groups of 3 stars
3. Arrays: Complete the array and write the total
4. Repeated Addition: Write 3 × 5 as 5 + 5 + 5 = ___

TOPIC 5: Division Introduction
Theory: Division is sharing equally into groups or grouping into equal sets.

Two Types:
- Sharing: 12 sweets shared between 3 children = 4 each
- Grouping: 12 sweets in groups of 3 = 4 groups

Examples:
- 10 ÷ 2 = 5 (10 shared between 2 = 5 each)
- 15 ÷ 5 = 3 (15 in groups of 5 = 3 groups)
- 20 ÷ 10 = 2

Worksheets:
1. Sharing: Share 12 counters between 4 people. Draw how many each gets
2. Grouping: Circle groups of 2 in a set of 14 objects
3. Division Pictures: 18 ÷ 6 = ___ (draw it)
4. Word Problems: "20 pencils in packs of 5. How many packs?"

TOPIC 6: Fractions - Halves and Quarters
Theory: Fractions represent parts of a whole or parts of a group. The whole must be divided into equal parts.

Halves (1/2):
- 1 whole divided into 2 equal parts
- 1/2 of 8 = 4
- Half of a shape or quantity

Quarters (1/4):
- 1 whole divided into 4 equal parts
- 1/4 of 8 = 2
- Quarter of a shape or quantity

Examples:
- Half of a pizza = 2 equal slices
- Half of 10 = 5
- Quarter of a square = 1 of 4 equal parts
- Quarter of 12 = 3

Worksheets:
1. Shade Halves: Color 1/2 of each shape
2. Find Halves: What is 1/2 of 16?
3. Quarters: Divide shapes into 4 equal parts
4. Fraction Problems: "I ate 1/4 of 8 cookies. How many did I eat?"

TOPIC 7: Geometry - 2D and 3D Shapes
Theory: Shapes have properties that help us identify and describe them.

2D Shapes Properties:
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 vertices (corners)
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
- Rectangle: 4 sides (opposite sides equal), 4 right angles
- Circle: curved, no sides, no vertices
- Pentagon: 5 sides, 5 vertices
- Hexagon: 6 sides, 6 vertices

3D Shapes Properties:
- Cube: 6 square faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Sphere: 1 curved surface, no edges, no vertices
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, 1 curved surface
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex, 1 curved surface
- Pyramid: triangular faces, 1 base, pointed top

Worksheets:
1. Name the Shape: Identify shapes and write their names
2. Properties Table: Complete a chart of sides, vertices, faces
3. Shape Sorting: Group shapes by number of sides
4. Real World: Find examples of shapes in the classroom

TOPIC 8: Measurement
Theory: We measure to find out how long, heavy, or much something is. We use units and tools to measure accurately.

Length:
- Non-standard units: cubes, hands, paperclips
- Standard units: centimeters (cm), meters (m)
- Measuring tools: ruler, tape measure
- Compare: longer, shorter, taller, same length

Weight/Mass:
- Non-standard: compare which is heavier
- Standard units: kilograms (kg)
- Measuring tools: balance scales, weighing scales
- Compare: heavier, lighter, same weight

Capacity/Volume:
- How much a container holds
- Standard units: liters (l), milliliters (ml)
- Compare: full, empty, half full, more, less

Worksheets:
1. Measure It: Use a ruler to measure lines in cm
2. Comparing Weight: Which is heavier - book or pencil?
3. Capacity: Order containers by how much they hold
4. Estimation: Estimate then measure the length of your desk

TOPIC 9: Time
Theory: We use clocks and calendars to measure and organize time.

Time Concepts:
- Days of the week: Monday to Sunday (7 days)
- Months of the year: January to December (12 months)
- Seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter

Telling Time:
- O'clock: minute hand on 12, hour hand shows hour
- Half past: minute hand on 6, hour hand halfway between hours
- Digital and analog clocks

Time Language:
- Before, after, next, yesterday, today, tomorrow
- Morning, afternoon, evening, night
- Earlier, later, quicker, slower

Worksheets:
1. Draw Clock Hands: Show 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock
2. Match Times: Connect analog clocks to digital times
3. Daily Routine: What time do you wake up? Eat breakfast?
4. Duration: Circle activities that take less than 1 minute
