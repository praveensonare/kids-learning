Year 1 English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 7: Poetry and Rhyme

Theory: Poems use rhythm, rhyme, and special language to create images and feelings.

Rhyming Patterns:
- Couplets: AA (lines 1&2 rhyme)
- Alternate: ABAB (lines 1&3, 2&4 rhyme)

Example Poem:
"The cat sat on the mat, (A)
And wore a little hat. (A)
The dog ran very far, (B)
To play with a toy car." (B)

Poetic Devices:
- Alliteration: "Silly snakes slither slowly"
- Repetition: "Jump, jump, jump!"
- Onomatopoeia: splash, bang, buzz

Worksheets:
1. Find the Rhyme: Circle pairs of rhyming words in the poem
2. Complete the Poem: Fill in the missing rhyming word
3. Write a Couplet: Two lines that rhyme about your pet
4. Alliteration: Write a sentence where most words start with 's'
