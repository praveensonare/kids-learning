Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Count reliably to 20 and beyond
- Recognize, order, and write numbers 0-20
- Understand addition and subtraction within 10
- Recognize and describe 2D and 3D shapes
- Compare and measure using non-standard units
- Understand time concepts and solve simple problems

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Counting and Number Recognition (0-20)
Theory: Counting is the foundation of mathematics. Understanding cardinality (the last number counted represents the total) is crucial. Numbers can be represented in different ways: numerals, words, pictures, objects.

Examples:
- Count 15 pencils: 1, 2, 3...15
- Number 0 means "nothing" or "none"
- Teen numbers: 13 is "ten and three more"
- Count backwards from 10: 10, 9, 8, 7...0

Worksheets:
1. Number Line: Fill in missing numbers on a 0-20 number line
2. Counting Objects: Count and write how many (up to 20 objects)
3. Number Formation: Write numbers 11-20 neatly
4. Matching: Match groups of objects to the correct numeral

TOPIC 2: One More, One Less
Theory: Understanding one more and one less develops number sense and prepares for addition and subtraction.

Examples:
- One more than 7 is 8
- One less than 10 is 9
- 5, 6, 7 (7 is one more than 6)
- Pattern: 12, 11, 10, 9 (counting backwards by one)

Worksheets:
1. Complete: One more than 14 is ___
2. Number Ladder: Fill in numbers going up (one more) and down (one less)
3. Domino Maths: Find dominoes showing one more or one less
4. Number Neighbors: What comes before and after 17?

TOPIC 3: Comparing Numbers
Theory: We can compare numbers using the language: greater than, less than, equal to, more, fewer, same.

Examples:
- 15 is greater than 12
- 8 is less than 10
- 6 = 6 (equal, same amount)
- Compare groups: 7 apples > 5 oranges

Worksheets:
1. Circle the Greater: Compare pairs of numbers (13 vs 17)
2. Order Numbers: Arrange 5, 12, 8, 3 from smallest to biggest
3. More or Less: Use > < = symbols (with support)
4. Picture Problems: Which group has more? Count and compare

TOPIC 4: Number Bonds to 10
Theory: Number bonds show pairs of numbers that combine to make a total. Knowing bonds to 10 by heart is essential for mental math.

Examples:
- 10 = 5 + 5
- 10 = 6 + 4
- 10 = 7 + 3
- 10 = 8 + 2
- 10 = 9 + 1
- 10 = 10 + 0

Worksheets:
1. Part-Whole Model: Complete the number bond diagram for 10
2. Missing Numbers: 10 = 3 + ___
3. Number Bond Families: Write all the bonds to 10
4. Ten Frame: Color 10 frames to show different bonds (7 red, 3 blue)

TOPIC 5: Addition Within 10
Theory: Addition means combining groups or adding more to a starting amount. We can use objects, pictures, or number lines to help us add.

Examples:
- 3 + 2 = 5 (three frogs plus two more frogs makes five frogs)
- 4 + 4 = 8 (double 4)
- 6 + 1 = 7 (six add one more)
- 0 + 5 = 5 (zero plus any number equals that number)

Worksheets:
1. Picture Addition: Count both groups and write the answer
2. Number Line Addition: Start at 4, jump forward 3, where do you land?
3. Addition Stories: "Sam has 3 cars. He gets 2 more. How many now?"
4. Missing Numbers: 5 + ___ = 8

TOPIC 6: Subtraction Within 10
Theory: Subtraction means taking away, finding the difference, or finding how many are left.

Examples:
- 7 - 2 = 5 (seven take away two leaves five)
- 10 - 4 = 6 (ten subtract four equals six)
- 8 - 0 = 8 (subtracting zero leaves the number unchanged)
- 5 - 5 = 0 (subtracting a number from itself gives zero)

Worksheets:
1. Cross Out: Cross out objects and count how many are left
2. Number Line Subtraction: Start at 9, jump back 4
3. Subtraction Stories: "There were 8 birds. 3 flew away. How many left?"
4. Fact Families: If 6 + 3 = 9, then 9 - 3 = 6

TOPIC 7: 2D and 3D Shapes
Theory: 2D shapes are flat with sides and corners. 3D shapes are solid with faces, edges, and vertices.

Examples:
2D Shapes:
- Circle: round, 0 sides, 0 corners
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 corners
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 corners
- Rectangle: 4 sides (2 long, 2 short), 4 corners
- Pentagon: 5 sides, 5 corners
- Hexagon: 6 sides, 6 corners

3D Shapes:
- Sphere: ball-shaped, rolls
- Cube: 6 square faces
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces (box)
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, rolls
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex, rolls
- Pyramid: triangular faces, pointed top

Worksheets:
1. Shape Properties: Count the sides and corners of each shape
2. Shape Sort: Group shapes by number of sides
3. 3D Shape Hunt: Find objects that are cubes, spheres, cylinders
4. Shape Patterns: Continue the pattern (triangle, circle, triangle...)

TOPIC 8: Measurement - Length, Weight, Capacity
Theory: We can measure and compare objects using non-standard units (cubes, hands) and mathematical language.

Length Examples:
- The pencil is 8 cubes long
- The table is longer than the chair
- Measure your hand span in cubes

Weight Examples:
- The book is heavier than the pencil
- Balance scales show which is heavier/lighter

Capacity Examples:
- This jug is full of water
- The cup is half full
- Container A holds more than container B

Worksheets:
1. Measuring: Use cubes to measure objects in the classroom
2. Comparing: Circle the heavier object, underline the lighter
3. Capacity: Order containers from holds least to holds most
4. Practical Problems: "How many cups fill the jug?"

TOPIC 9: Time
Theory: We measure time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. Clocks help us tell the time.

Examples:
- Days of the week: Monday, Tuesday... Sunday (7 days)
- Months: January, February... December (12 months)
- O'clock: The long hand points to 12, short hand shows the hour
- Half past: The long hand points to 6
- Yesterday, today, tomorrow
- Morning, afternoon, evening, night

Worksheets:
1. Days of the Week: Put the days in order
2. Time Matching: Match clock faces to times (3 o'clock, 7 o'clock)
3. Daily Routine: When do you eat breakfast? (morning)
4. Duration: Circle activities that take a long time

Sample Activities:
- Number of the Day: Explore one number in depth (ways to make it, one more/less, etc.)
- Mental Maths Games: Quick-fire addition and subtraction facts
- Shape Building: Use 2D shapes to make pictures, use 3D shapes to build towers
- Practical Measuring: Measure classroom objects using cubes, hands, feet
- Money Games: Shop role-play with coins (1p, 2p, 5p, 10p)
- Number Line Hopscotch: Jump forwards and backwards
- Ten Frame Flash: Show number bonds to 10 quickly
- Pattern Making: Create and continue AB, ABB, ABC patterns
- Sorting and Grouping: Sort objects by properties (color, size, shape)
- Problem Solving: Real-life word problems
