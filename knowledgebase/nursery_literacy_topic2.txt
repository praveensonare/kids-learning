Nursery Literacy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 2: Phonological Awareness and Sounds

Theory: Phonological awareness is hearing and playing with sounds in words. This includes rhyming, alliteration, and breaking words into syllables. It prepares children for reading and spelling.

Sound Activities:
- Clap syllables in names: Sam (1 clap), Emma (2 claps)
- Identify rhyming words: cat, hat, mat
- Recognize initial sounds: /s/ sun, sock, sand
- Listen for sounds in environment (birds, cars, water)

Examples:
- Rhyme time: "The cat sat on the mat"
- Alliteration: "Silly Sam saw seven snakes"
- Sound games: "I spy something beginning with /b/"
- Syllable counting: "Let's clap your name: Ma-ri-a (3 claps)"

Worksheets:
1. Rhyme Match: Draw lines between rhyming pictures (cat-hat, dog-log)
2. Initial Sounds: Circle pictures starting with /s/
3. Syllable Sort: Group pictures by number of syllables
4. Sound Hunt: Find objects in the room starting with /m/
