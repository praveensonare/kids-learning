Year 1 English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Apply phonic knowledge to read and spell words accurately
- Read common exception words fluently
- Write sentences with correct punctuation and grammar
- Understand and retell stories with proper sequence
- Develop vocabulary through reading and discussion
- Participate confidently in speaking and listening activities

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Phonics - Phase 5 and Beyond
Theory: Phase 5 phonics introduces alternative spellings for sounds already learned. Children learn that the same sound can be spelled in different ways (ai/ay/a-e for the long 'a' sound).

Alternative Spellings Examples:
- Long 'a': ai (rain), ay (play), a-e (cake), a (table)
- Long 'e': ee (tree), ea (sea), e-e (these), e (he), ie (field)
- Long 'i': igh (light), i-e (bike), y (fly), ie (pie)
- Long 'o': oa (boat), o-e (bone), ow (snow), o (go)
- Long 'u': ue (blue), u-e (cute), ew (new)

Worksheets:
1. Sort Words: Group words by their spelling pattern (rain, play, cake all have long 'a')
2. Read and Match: Read words and match to pictures (night, light, bright)
3. Spell Check: Circle the correct spelling (rane, rain, rayn)
4. Phoneme Frames: How many sounds in "night"? (3: n-igh-t)

TOPIC 2: Common Exception Words
Theory: These high-frequency words don't follow regular phonic patterns and must be learned by sight.

Year 1 Common Exception Words:
the, a, do, to, today, of, said, says, are, were, was, is, his, has, I, you, your, they, be, he, me, she, we, no, go, so, by, my, here, there, where, love, come, some, one, once, ask, friend, school, put, push, pull, full, house, our

3. Word Search: Find 10 exception words in the grid
4. Missing Letters: c_me, s_me, fr_ _nd

TOPIC 3: Reading Comprehension
Theory: Good readers make sense of what they read by thinking about characters, events, and meanings. They can answer questions and make predictions.

Reading Strategies:
- Sound out unfamiliar words
- Use picture clues
- Re-read if confused
- Think about what makes sense
- Predict what happens next
- Visualize the story

Comprehension Questions:
- Who? (characters)
- What? (events)
- Where? (setting)
- When? (time)
- Why? (reasons)
- How? (method)

Example Text: "Jack climbed the tall beanstalk. He saw a giant's castle in the clouds. Jack felt scared but he was brave."

Questions:
- Who climbed the beanstalk? (Jack)
- What did Jack see? (A giant's castle)
- How did Jack feel? (Scared but brave)

4. Character Feelings: How did the character feel at the start? At the end?

TOPIC 4: Sentence Writing
Theory: Sentences express complete thoughts. They must start with capital letters, have correct spaces, and end with appropriate punctuation (. ! ?).

Sentence Types:
- Statement: "The cat is black." (full stop)
- Question: "Where is the cat?" (question mark)
- Exclamation: "What a big cat!" (exclamation mark)
- Command: "Feed the cat." (full stop)

Sentence Checklist:
✓ Capital letter at start
✓ Finger spaces between words
✓ Makes sense
✓ Correct punctuation at end
✓ Proper letter formation

Worksheets:
1. Fix the Sentence: "the dog ran fast" → "The dog ran fast."
2. Add Punctuation: "Where are you going__ I am going to school__"
3. Expand Sentences: "I like dogs." → "I like big, fluffy dogs with wagging tails."
4. Type the Sentence: Identify if statement, question, command, or exclamation

TOPIC 5: Grammar Basics
Theory: Understanding parts of speech helps us construct correct and interesting sentences.

Nouns: Names of people, places, things, animals
Examples: cat, London, book, teacher, happiness

Verbs: Action or being words
Examples: run, jump, eat, is, was, has

Adjectives: Describing words (tell us more about nouns)
Examples: big, small, red, happy, fluffy

Plural Nouns:
- Add -s: cat → cats, dog → dogs
- Add -es: box → boxes, church → churches
- Irregular: child → children, mouse → mice

2. Verb Actions: Match verbs to pictures of actions
3. Adjective Addition: Add adjectives: "The ___ dog played with a ___ ball."
4. Singular to Plural: Write the plural form of 10 nouns

TOPIC 6: Story Writing
Theory: Stories have a clear structure with beginning, middle, and end. They include characters, settings, and events.

Story Structure:
- Beginning: Introduce characters and setting
- Middle: Problem or adventure happens
- End: Problem solved, story concludes

Story Elements:
- Who: Characters (give them names)
- Where: Setting (describe the place)
- When: Time (morning, long ago, etc.)
- What: Events (what happens)
- Feelings: How characters feel

Example Story Plan:
Beginning: "Once upon a time, there was a brave knight named Sir Tom."
Middle: "He went to rescue a dragon from a mean wizard."
End: "Sir Tom freed the dragon and they became friends."

Worksheets:
1. Story Plan: Draw and label beginning, middle, end
2. Character Description: Draw and describe your character
3. Story Starter: Continue "One day, I found a magic key..."
4. Rewrite: Retell a fairy tale in your own words

TOPIC 7: Poetry and Rhyme
Theory: Poems use rhythm, rhyme, and special language to create images and feelings.

Rhyming Patterns:
- Couplets: AA (lines 1&2 rhyme)
- Alternate: ABAB (lines 1&3, 2&4 rhyme)

Example Poem:
"The cat sat on the mat, (A)
And wore a little hat. (A)
The dog ran very far, (B)
To play with a toy car." (B)

Poetic Devices:
- Alliteration: "Silly snakes slither slowly"
