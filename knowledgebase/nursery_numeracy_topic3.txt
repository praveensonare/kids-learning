Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 3: One More and One Less

Theory: Understanding one more and one less builds number sense. It helps children see relationships between numbers and prepares them for addition and subtraction.

Number Relationships:
- One more than 3 is 4
- One less than 5 is 4
- Numbers go in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Each number is one more than the last
- We can count forwards (more) or backwards (less)

Examples:
- You have 3 cookies, get one more = 4 cookies
- You have 5 balloons, one pops = 4 balloons left
- Number stairs: 1 step up is one more
- Number ladder: climb up (more) or down (less)

Worksheets:
1. Add One More: Draw one more object and count total
2. Take One Away: Cross out one object, count what's left
3. Number Neighbors: Fill in the numbers before and after
4. More or Less: Circle the group with one more
