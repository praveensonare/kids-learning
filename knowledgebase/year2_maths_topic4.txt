Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 4: Fractions

Theory: Fractions represent equal parts of a whole or a group.

Unit Fractions:
- 1/2: one half (1 out of 2 equal parts)
- 1/3: one third (1 out of 3 equal parts)
- 1/4: one quarter (1 out of 4 equal parts)

Non-Unit Fractions:
- 2/4: two quarters (2 out of 4 equal parts)
- 3/4: three quarters (3 out of 4 equal parts)
- 2/3: two thirds (2 out of 3 equal parts)

Finding Fractions of Amounts:
- 1/2 of 12 = 6 (divide by 2)
- 1/4 of 20 = 5 (divide by 4)
- 3/4 of 20 = 15 (find 1/4 first, then ×3)

Equivalent Fractions:
- 1/2 = 2/4 (same amount)
- Two halves = one whole

Worksheets:
1. Shade Fractions: Color 1/3, 2/4, 3/4 of shapes
2. Fractions of Amounts: Find 1/2, 1/4, 1/3 of numbers
3. Equivalent Fractions: Match equal fractions
4. Compare Fractions: Which is bigger? 1/2 or 1/4?
