Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Counting and Number Recognition (0-20)

Theory: Counting is the foundation of mathematics. Understanding cardinality (the last number counted represents the total) is crucial. Numbers can be represented in different ways: numerals, words, pictures, objects.

Examples:
- Count 15 pencils: 1, 2, 3...15
- Number 0 means "nothing" or "none"
- Teen numbers: 13 is "ten and three more"
- Count backwards from 10: 10, 9, 8, 7...0

Worksheets:
1. Number Line: Fill in missing numbers on a 0-20 number line
2. Counting Objects: Count and write how many (up to 20 objects)
3. Number Formation: Write numbers 11-20 neatly
4. Matching: Match groups of objects to the correct numeral
