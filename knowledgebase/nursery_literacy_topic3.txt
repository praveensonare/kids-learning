Nursery Literacy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 3: Print Awareness

Theory: Print awareness is understanding how books and written language work. Children learn that print carries meaning, we read from left to right, and books have specific parts.

Book Concepts:
- Hold book right way up
- Turn pages from right to left
- Know where to start reading (top left)
- Understand that pictures and words tell the story
- Recognize front cover, back cover, title

Examples:
- Point to where we start reading
- Show how to turn pages correctly
- Identify the title of a favorite book
- Understand that words are made of letters
- Know that we read from left to right, top to bottom

Worksheets:
1. Book Parts: Label the front cover, spine, back cover
2. Reading Direction: Follow arrows showing left to right
3. Picture Walk: Tell the story using only pictures
4. Find the Title: Circle the title on different book covers
