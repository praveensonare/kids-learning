Year 1 English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Phonics - Phase 5 and Beyond

Theory: Phase 5 phonics introduces alternative spellings for sounds already learned. Children learn that the same sound can be spelled in different ways (ai/ay/a-e for the long 'a' sound).

Alternative Spellings Examples:
- Long 'a': ai (rain), ay (play), a-e (cake), a (table)
- Long 'e': ee (tree), ea (sea), e-e (these), e (he), ie (field)
- Long 'i': igh (light), i-e (bike), y (fly), ie (pie)
- Long 'o': oa (boat), o-e (bone), ow (snow), o (go)
- Long 'u': ue (blue), u-e (cute), ew (new)

Worksheets:
1. Sort Words: Group words by their spelling pattern (rain, play, cake all have long 'a')
2. Read and Match: Read words and match to pictures (night, light, bright)
3. Spell Check: Circle the correct spelling (rane, rain, rayn)
4. Phoneme Frames: How many sounds in "night"? (3: n-igh-t)
