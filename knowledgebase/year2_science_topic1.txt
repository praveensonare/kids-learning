Year 2 Science - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Living Things and Their Habitats

Theory: Living things live in habitats that provide what they need. Different habitats support different plants and animals.

Habitats:
- Woodland: trees, fallen logs, soil (squirrels, birds, insects, foxes, deer)
- Ocean: salt water, rocks, sand (fish, whales, crabs, seaweed, coral)
- Pond: fresh water, plants, mud (frogs, newts, fish, dragonflies, pond skaters)
- Rainforest: hot, wet, many trees (monkeys, parrots, snakes, jaguars)
- Desert: hot, dry, sand (camels, lizards, scorpions, cacti)
- Arctic: cold, ice, snow (polar bears, penguins, seals, arctic foxes)

Micro-habitats:
- Under log: woodlice, beetles, worms, slugs
- Tree bark: insects, moss, lichen
- Pond edge: frogs, newts, water plants
- Stone wall: spiders, insects, moss

Food Chains:
- Producer: plant makes own food (grass, tree)
- Consumer: animal eats plants or other animals
- Simple chain: grass → rabbit → fox
- Another chain: leaves → caterpillar → bird → cat

Worksheets:
1. Habitat Match: Connect animals to their habitats
2. Micro-habitat Hunt: Record what you find under logs, stones
3. Food Chain: Create food chains using local animals
4. Living/Non-living: Sort items into living, once lived, never lived
