Nursery Literacy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Alphabet Recognition

Theory: The alphabet has 26 letters. Each letter has an uppercase (capital) form and a lowercase (small) form. Letters have names (A, B, C) and sounds (/a/, /b/, /c/). Learning to recognize letters is the first step in reading.

Letter Formation:
- Start with letters in the child's name
- Learn uppercase letters first (A, B, C...)
- Then introduce lowercase letters (a, b, c...)
- Focus on letter shapes and orientation

Examples:
- A is for Apple, Ant, Astronaut
- B is for Ball, Butterfly, Banana
- Point to letter A in "APPLE" sign
- Find the letter M in "Mummy"

Worksheets:
1. Letter Hunt: Circle all the letter A's in a picture
2. Match Game: Match uppercase A with lowercase a
3. Tracing: Trace over dotted letter shapes
4. Letter Collage: Find pictures starting with letter B
