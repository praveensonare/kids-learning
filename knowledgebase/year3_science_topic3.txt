TOPIC 3: Rocks and Soils

Types of rocks:
- Igneous: formed from lava/magma (granite, basalt)
- Sedimentary: layers compressed over time (sandstone, limestone, chalk)
- Metamorphic: changed by heat/pressure (marble, slate)

Properties:
- Hard or soft
- Permeable (water passes through) or impermeable
- Texture: smooth, rough, grainy

Soil formation:
- Weathering breaks down rocks
- Organic matter (dead plants/animals) mixes in
- Different soil types: sandy, clay, loamy

Fossils:
- Remains of prehistoric plants/animals preserved in rock
- Tell us about past life
