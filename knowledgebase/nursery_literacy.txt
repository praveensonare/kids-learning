Nursery Literacy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Recognize and name all letters of the alphabet
- Understand that letters represent sounds
- Develop phonological awareness through rhymes and songs
- Handle books correctly and understand print concepts
- Begin to form recognizable letters
- Listen to and enjoy stories
- Develop speaking and listening skills

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Alphabet Recognition
Theory: The alphabet has 26 letters. Each letter has an uppercase (capital) form and a lowercase (small) form. Letters have names (A, B, C) and sounds (/a/, /b/, /c/). Learning to recognize letters is the first step in reading.

Letter Formation:
- Start with letters in the child's name
- Learn uppercase letters first (A, B, C...)
- Then introduce lowercase letters (a, b, c...)
- Focus on letter shapes and orientation

Examples:
- A is for Apple, Ant, Astronaut
- B is for Ball, Butterfly, Banana
- Point to letter A in "APPLE" sign
- Find the letter M in "Mummy"

Worksheets:
1. Letter Hunt: Circle all the letter A's in a picture
2. Match Game: Match uppercase A with lowercase a
3. Tracing: Trace over dotted letter shapes
4. Letter Collage: Find pictures starting with letter B

TOPIC 2: Phonological Awareness and Sounds
Theory: Phonological awareness is hearing and playing with sounds in words. This includes rhyming, alliteration, and breaking words into syllables. It prepares children for reading and spelling.

Sound Activities:
- Clap syllables in names: Sam (1 clap), Emma (2 claps)
- Identify rhyming words: cat, hat, mat
- Recognize initial sounds: /s/ sun, sock, sand
- Listen for sounds in environment (birds, cars, water)

Examples:
- Rhyme time: "The cat sat on the mat"
- Alliteration: "Silly Sam saw seven snakes"
- Sound games: "I spy something beginning with /b/"
- Syllable counting: "Let's clap your name: Ma-ri-a (3 claps)"

Worksheets:
1. Rhyme Match: Draw lines between rhyming pictures (cat-hat, dog-log)
2. Initial Sounds: Circle pictures starting with /s/
3. Syllable Sort: Group pictures by number of syllables
4. Sound Hunt: Find objects in the room starting with /m/

TOPIC 3: Print Awareness
Theory: Print awareness is understanding how books and written language work. Children learn that print carries meaning, we read from left to right, and books have specific parts.

Book Concepts:
- Hold book right way up
- Turn pages from right to left
- Know where to start reading (top left)
- Understand that pictures and words tell the story
- Recognize front cover, back cover, title

Examples:
- Point to where we start reading
- Show how to turn pages correctly
- Identify the title of a favorite book
- Understand that words are made of letters
- Know that we read from left to right, top to bottom

Worksheets:
1. Book Parts: Label the front cover, spine, back cover
2. Reading Direction: Follow arrows showing left to right
3. Picture Walk: Tell the story using only pictures
4. Find the Title: Circle the title on different book covers

TOPIC 4: Story Comprehension
Theory: Listening to stories helps children develop language, imagination, and understanding. They learn to follow sequences, predict events, and relate stories to their own experiences.

Story Elements:
- Characters: Who is in the story?
- Setting: Where does it happen?
- Beginning, middle, end
- Favorite part of the story
- Feelings of characters

Examples:
- "The Three Little Pigs": Who are the characters? (3 pigs, wolf)
- What happened first? (Pigs built houses)
- How did the pigs feel? (scared, then safe)
- What's your favorite part?

Worksheets:
1. Story Sequence: Put 3 pictures in order (beginning, middle, end)
2. Character Match: Match characters to their stories
3. Feelings Chart: Draw how the character felt
4. Favorite Part: Draw your favorite part of the story

TOPIC 5: Pre-Writing Skills
Theory: Pre-writing activities develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination needed for writing. Children practice pencil grip, control, and basic shapes that form letters.

Pre-Writing Patterns:
- Vertical lines (down)
- Horizontal lines (across)
- Circles (round and round)
- Diagonal lines (slanting)
- Zigzags and waves

Examples:
- Draw rain (vertical lines down)
- Draw a road (horizontal line across)
- Draw balloons (circles)
- Draw a mountain (zigzag line)
- Trace dotted patterns

Worksheets:
1. Line Practice: Trace vertical and horizontal lines
2. Circle Time: Draw lots of bubbles (circles)
3. Pattern Complete: Continue the pattern (line, circle, line...)
4. Shape Drawing: Draw squares, triangles, circles

TOPIC 6: Rhyming and Word Families
Theory: Rhyming words end with the same sound. Recognizing rhymes helps children hear patterns in language and prepares them for reading word families.

Rhyming Families:
- -at family: cat, hat, mat, sat, rat
- -an family: can, man, pan, fan, ran
- -ig family: big, dig, pig, wig, jig
- -op family: top, hop, mop, pop, stop

Examples:
- "Hickory Dickory Dock" (clock/dock rhyme)
- "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" (are/star rhyme)
- "Does cat rhyme with hat?" (Yes!)
- "Find a word that rhymes with dog" (log, fog, jog)

Worksheets:
1. Rhyme Time: Circle pictures that rhyme (hen-pen, fox-box)
2. Odd One Out: Cross out the picture that doesn't rhyme
3. Rhyme Match: Draw lines connecting rhyming pairs
4. Make a Rhyme: Think of words that rhyme with "sun"

TOPIC 7: Speaking and Listening
Theory: Speaking and listening skills are essential for communication and learning. Children learn to express themselves clearly, listen attentively, and take turns in conversations.

Communication Skills:
- Listen without interrupting
- Take turns speaking
- Make eye contact
- Speak clearly
- Ask and answer questions
- Follow simple instructions

Examples:
- "Show and Tell" time: share a toy and talk about it
- Circle time discussions: "What did you do at the weekend?"
- Follow instructions: "Put your hand on your head"
- Answer questions: "What color is this?"

Worksheets:
1. Instruction Following: Color the ball red, circle the cat
2. Picture Talk: Look at a picture and talk about what you see
3. Question Cards: Answer simple who, what, where questions
4. Sequence Instructions: Follow 2-step instructions (stand up, then clap)

Sample Activities:
- Letter of the Week: Focus on one letter through songs, crafts, and games
- Storytime: Daily read-aloud with picture books
- Rhyme Time: Sing nursery rhymes with actions
- Name Recognition: Find and write own name
- Sound Walks: Listen for sounds in the environment
- Letter Hunt: Find letters in magazines and newspapers
- Playdough Letters: Form letters with playdough
- Alphabet Songs: Sing ABC song daily
- Book Corner: Independent book browsing
- Puppet Shows: Retell stories with puppets

Assessment Ideas:
- Recognizes most letters of the alphabet
- Identifies some initial sounds in words
- Enjoys listening to stories
- Can retell simple events in sequence
- Holds pencil with correct grip
- Attempts to write some letters, especially from own name
- Joins in with rhymes and songs
- Listens attentively in group situations
- Speaks clearly enough to be understood
- Follows simple one and two-step instructions
