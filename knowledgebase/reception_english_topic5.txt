Reception English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 5: Sentence Writing

Theory: Sentences express complete thoughts. They start with capital letters, have spaces between words, and end with punctuation marks (. ! ?).

Examples:
- "I like cats." (statement - full stop)
- "Can you jump?" (question - question mark)
- "Look out!" (exclamation - exclamation mark)

Sentence Checklist:
✓ Capital letter at the start
✓ Finger spaces between words
✓ Full stop at the end
✓ Sounds right when read aloud

Worksheets:
1. Fix the Sentence: "i like dogs" → "I like dogs."
2. Sentence Building: Use word cards to make: "The dog is big."
3. Write a Sentence: Write about your favorite toy
4. Add Punctuation: Put full stops and capital letters in the right places
