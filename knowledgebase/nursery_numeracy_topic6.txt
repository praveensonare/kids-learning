TOPIC 6: Patterns

Theory: Patterns are things that repeat in a predictable way. Recognizing and creating patterns helps develop logical thinking and mathematical reasoning.

Pattern Types:

- ABB pattern: star, heart, heart, star, heart, heart
- ABC pattern: circle, square, triangle, circle, square, triangle
- Growing patterns: 1 block, 2 blocks, 3 blocks

Examples:
- Clap, stamp, clap, stamp (AB pattern)
- Big, small, small, big, small, small (ABB pattern)
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (days repeat)
- Stripes on a shirt (color patterns)

Worksheets:
1. Continue the Pattern: What comes next? (circle, square, circle, ?)
2. Create a Pattern: Use stickers to make an AB pattern
3. Pattern Hunt: Find patterns in the classroom
4. Copy the Pattern: Make the same pattern with different colors
