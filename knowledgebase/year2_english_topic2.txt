Year 2 English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 2: Reading Comprehension and Inference

Theory: Good readers make inferences by using clues in the text plus their own knowledge to understand deeper meanings.

Comprehension Skills:
- Literal understanding: Find information directly stated
- Inference: Work out what's implied but not said
- Prediction: Use clues to guess what happens next
- Cause and effect: Understand why things happen
- Character feelings: Infer how characters feel and why
- Vocabulary in context: Work out word meanings from context

Question Types:
- Find and copy: "Find and copy two words that describe..."
- Why?: "Why did the character...?"
- How do you know?: "How do you know the character was sad?"
- What does this word mean?: Vocabulary in context
- Summarize: "What happened in this part?"

Example Text:
"Mia dragged her feet as she walked to school. She had forgotten to do her homework again. Her tummy felt funny and her hands were shaking as she reached the classroom door."

Inferences:
- Mia is worried/nervous (tummy funny, shaking hands)
- She's in trouble (forgot homework)
- She doesn't want to go to school (dragging feet)

Worksheets:
1. Inference Practice: Read short texts, answer "How do you know?" questions
2. Character Feelings: Identify feelings and find evidence
3. Cause and Effect: Match causes to their effects
4. Predict: Read part of story, predict ending, check if correct
