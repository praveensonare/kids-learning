TOPIC 9: Simple Subtraction (Taking Away)

Theory: Subtraction means taking some away from a group to find how many are left. We cross out or remove objects to see what remains.

Subtracting Concepts:
- Start with a group
- Take some away (cross out)
- Count what's left
- Use objects or pictures to help

Examples:
- 5 balloons, 2 pop, 3 balloons left
- 4 cookies, eat 1, 3 cookies remain
- 3 birds, 1 flies away, 2 birds left
- Cross out 2 from a group of 5, count what's left (3)

Worksheets:
1. Cross Out: Start with 5 objects, cross out 2, count what's left
2. Take Away Stories: "6 ducks, 2 swim away, how many left?"
3. Picture Subtraction: Color the objects left after some are taken away
4. Before and After: Draw before (5 apples) and after eating 1 (4 apples)
