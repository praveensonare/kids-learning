Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Living Things and Their Habitats
Theory: Living things live in habitats that provide what they need. Different habitats support different plants and animals.

Habitats:
- Woodland: trees, fallen logs, soil (squirrels, birds, insects, foxes, deer)
- Ocean: salt water, rocks, sand (fish, whales, crabs, seaweed, coral)
- Pond: fresh water, plants, mud (frogs, newts, fish, dragonflies, pond skaters)
- Rainforest: hot, wet, many trees (monkeys, parrots, snakes, jaguars)
- Desert: hot, dry, sand (camels, lizards, scorpions, cacti)
- Arctic: cold, ice, snow (polar bears, penguins, seals, arctic foxes)

Micro-habitats:
- Under log: woodlice, beetles, worms, slugs
- Tree bark: insects, moss, lichen
- Pond edge: frogs, newts, water plants
- Stone wall: spiders, insects, moss

Food Chains:
- Producer: plant makes own food (grass, tree)
- Consumer: animal eats plants or other animals
- Simple chain: grass → rabbit → fox
- Another chain: leaves → caterpillar → bird → cat

Worksheets:
1. Habitat Match: Connect animals to their habitats
2. Micro-habitat Hunt: Record what you find under logs, stones
3. Food Chain: Create food chains using local animals
4. Living/Non-living: Sort items into living, once lived, never lived

TOPIC 2: Plants
Theory: Plants are essential for life. They grow from seeds and have specific needs.

What Plants Need to Stay Healthy:
- Light: photosynthesis, makes food
- Water: for growth, keeps plant firm
- Suitable temperature: not too hot or cold
- Space: room to grow

How Seeds Disperse:
- Wind: dandelion, sycamore (lightweight, parachutes, wings)
- Animals: burrs stick to fur, fruit eaten then seeds dropped
- Water: coconut floats to new places
- Explosion: pea pods burst open, shoots seeds out

Seed to Plant Investigation:
- Plant beans/cress in different conditions
- Test: no water, no light, no warmth, perfect conditions
- Observe differences in growth
- Record with photos and measurements

Parts and Their Jobs:
- Roots: anchor plant, absorb water and nutrients
- Stem: support, transport water and nutrients
- Leaves: make food through photosynthesis, breathe
- Flower: reproduction, attract insects, make seeds
- Seeds: contain baby plant, food store, grow into new plant

Worksheets:
1. Plant Needs Experiment: Record plant growth in different conditions
2. Seed Dispersal: Match seeds to their dispersal method
3. Label Diagram: Parts of a flowering plant
4. Growth Diary: Measure and record bean plant weekly

TOPIC 3: Animals Including Humans
Theory: Animals need food, water, and air. They have offspring which grow into adults. We must care for our bodies.

Basic Needs:
- Food: energy and nutrients
- Water: stay hydrated, bodies need water
- Air: breathe oxygen
- Shelter: protection from weather and predators

Offspring (babies):
- Mammals: give birth to live young (kittens, puppies, calves, babies)
- Birds: lay eggs, keep warm, chicks hatch
- Amphibians: lay eggs in water, tadpoles → frogs
- Reptiles: most lay eggs, baby looks like mini adult
- Insects: eggs → larva → pupa → adult (metamorphosis)

Growth:
- Baby → child → teenager → adult → elderly
- Animals grow and change as they get older
- Need right food and care to grow healthily

Staying Healthy:
- Balanced diet: fruits, vegetables, proteins, carbs, dairy
- Exercise: 60 minutes daily for children, makes strong
- Hygiene: wash hands, brush teeth, shower, clean clothes
- Sleep: 10-11 hours for children aged 6-13
- Water: 6-8 glasses daily

Worksheets:
1. Life Cycles: Arrange pictures showing animal growth stages
2. Food Groups: Sort foods into groups, plan balanced meal
3. Exercise Diary: Record physical activities for one week
4. Hygiene Checklist: Daily habits for staying clean and healthy

TOPIC 4: Uses of Everyday Materials
Theory: Materials have properties that make them suitable for specific uses. We can change materials in different ways.

Material Properties and Uses:
- Waterproof: plastic (raincoats, umbrellas, bottles)
- Transparent: glass (windows, glasses, jars)
- Flexible: rubber (elastic bands, tyres, hoses)
- Hard: metal (tools, nails, screws, cars)
- Soft: fabric (cushions, clothes, curtains)
- Strong: wood (furniture, buildings, pencils)

How Materials Change:
- Squashing: playdough, sponge, bread
- Bending: wire, plastic ruler, card
- Twisting: cloth, wire, rope
- Stretching: elastic, rubber band, spring
- Some change permanently (bread squashed)
- Some return to original shape (sponge, elastic)

Suitability of Materials:
- Why is metal good for saucepans? (hard, strong, conducts heat)
- Why is glass good for windows? (transparent, waterproof)
- Why is wood good for furniture? (strong, hard, can be shaped)
- Why is plastic good for toys? (colorful, light, strong, safe)

Recycling:
- Reuse materials instead of throwing away
- Glass, plastic, paper, metal can be recycled
- Reduces waste, saves resources, helps environment

Worksheets:
1. Material Properties: Test and record material properties
2. Best Material: Choose suitable materials for different objects
3. Change Investigation: Test which materials can be squashed/bent/stretched
4. Recycling Sort: Which bin does each item go in?

TOPIC 5: Seasonal Changes
Theory: The four seasons have different weather, daylight hours, and effects on living things.

Detailed Season Observations:

Spring (March-May):
- Temperature: warmer, 8-15°C
- Daylight: increasing (12-16 hours)
- Weather: showers, some sunny days, warmer
- Plants: buds, blossoms, new leaves, flowers bloom
- Animals: baby animals born, birds nest, butterflies emerge
- Activities: plant seeds, spring clean, Easter

Summer (June-August):
- Temperature: warm to hot, 15-25°C
- Daylight: longest days (16-17 hours)
- Weather: sunny, occasional rain, warmest season
- Plants: full leaves, fruits ripen, flowers in full bloom
- Animals: young animals grow, lots of insects, birds feed young
- Activities: holidays, beach, outdoor games, summer sports

Autumn (September-November):
- Temperature: cooling, 10-18°C
- Daylight: decreasing (10-14 hours)
- Weather: windy, rain, cooler, misty mornings
- Plants: leaves turn red/orange/brown, fall, conkers, harvest
- Animals: prepare for winter, gather food, some migrate
- Activities: harvest festival, Halloween, collect leaves

Winter (December-February):
- Temperature: cold, 0-8°C
- Daylight: shortest days (7-9 hours)
- Weather: cold, frost, maybe snow, icy
- Plants: deciduous trees bare, evergreens keep leaves, not much grows
