Year3 Maths - Chapter 1: Place Value

TOPIC 1: Understanding Hundreds, Tens and Ones

Theory:
Place value is the value of a digit based on its position in a number. In a 3-digit number, we have:
- Hundreds place (leftmost digit)
- Tens place (middle digit)
- Ones place (rightmost digit)

For example, in the number 347:
- 3 is in the hundreds place = 3 × 100 = 300
- 4 is in the tens place = 4 × 10 = 40
- 7 is in the ones place = 7 × 1 = 7
Total: 300 + 40 + 7 = 347

Examples:
Example 1: What is the value of 5 in the number 562?
Solution: 5 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 5 × 100 = 500

Example 2: Partition the number 438 into hundreds, tens and ones.
Solution: 438 = 400 + 30 + 8

Example 3: Which digit is in the tens place in 721?
Solution: The digit 2 is in the tens place and represents 20

TOPIC 2: Comparing and Ordering Numbers

Theory:
When comparing numbers, we look at digits from left to right:
1. Start with the hundreds place
2. If hundreds are equal, check tens
3. If tens are equal, check ones

Symbols: < (less than), > (greater than), = (equal to)

For example, comparing 456 and 482:
- Hundreds: 4 = 4 (same)
- Tens: 5 < 8 (different!)
- Therefore: 456 < 482

Examples:
Example 1: Compare 365 and 341
Hundreds: 3 = 3, Tens: 6 > 4
Answer: 365 > 341

Example 2: Order 527, 572, 257 from smallest to largest
Answer: 257, 527, 572

Example 3: Which is greater: 8 hundreds or 790?
800 > 790, so 8 hundreds is greater

TOPIC 3: Rounding Numbers

Theory:
Rounding makes numbers simpler to work with.

Rounding to nearest 10:
- Look at the ones digit
- If it's 5 or more, round UP
- If it's 4 or less, round DOWN

Rounding to nearest 100:
- Look at the tens digit
- If it's 50 or more, round UP
- If it's 40 or less, round DOWN

Example: Round 347 to nearest 10
- Ones digit is 7 (≥5)
- Round UP: 347 → 350

Example: Round 347 to nearest 100
- Tens is 4 (≤4)
- Round DOWN: 347 → 300

Examples:
Example 1: Round 563 to nearest 10
Ones = 3 (less than 5), so round down: 560

Example 2: Round 563 to nearest 100
Tens = 6 (more than 5), so round up: 600

Example 3: Round 450 to nearest 100
Tens = 5 (exactly 5), so round up: 500

Interactive Worksheet:

TOPIC 4: Number Patterns

Theory:
Number patterns follow rules. Common patterns:

Counting in steps:
- Count in 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...
- Count in 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...
- Count in 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...
- Count in 100s: 100, 200, 300, 400...

Finding the rule:
1. Look at differences between numbers
2. Check if difference is constant
3. Apply rule to find next numbers

Example: 15, 25, 35, 45, ?
Difference = 10 each time
Next number = 45 + 10 = 55

Examples:
Example 1: Continue the pattern: 130, 140, 150, __
Rule: +10 each time. Answer: 160

Example 2: What is the rule? 3, 6, 9, 12, 15
Rule: Add 3 or count in 3s

Example 3: Fill in: 200, __, 400, 500
Rule: +100. Missing number: 300
