Nursery Science - Discovery and Exploration
TOPIC 3: Our Bodies and Senses

Theory: We have five senses that help us explore the world. Our bodies have different parts that do different jobs.

The Five Senses:
1. Sight (eyes): We see colors, shapes, light, dark
2. Hearing (ears): We hear sounds - loud, quiet, high, low
3. Touch (skin/hands): We feel textures - soft, hard, smooth, rough, hot, cold
4. Taste (tongue): We taste flavors - sweet, salty, sour, bitter
5. Smell (nose): We smell scents - nice, nasty, flowers, food

Body Parts:
- Head: brain (thinks), eyes (see), ears (hear), nose (smell), mouth (taste/eat)
- Arms and hands: reach, hold, touch, write
- Legs and feet: walk, run, jump, kick
- Heart: pumps blood around body
- Tummy: digests food

Worksheets:
1. Which Sense?: Match activities to senses (looking at book = sight, eating apple = taste)
2. Body Parts: Label head, arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, nose, mouth on outline
3. Texture Hunt: Find and draw things that are soft, hard, smooth, rough
4. Keeping Healthy: Circle healthy choices (fruit, exercise, washing hands)
