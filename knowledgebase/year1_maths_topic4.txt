TOPIC 4: Multiplication Introduction

Theory: Multiplication means repeated addition of equal groups. It's a quicker way to add the same number many times.

Skip Counting:
- Count in 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... (pairs)
- Count in 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30... (hands, fingers)
- Count in 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50... (tens)

Equal Groups:
- 3 groups of 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- 4 groups of 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20
- Arrays: rows and columns

Examples:
- "There are 5 boxes. Each box has 2 toys. How many toys altogether?" 
  5 groups of 2 = 10 toys

Worksheets:
1. Skip Counting: Fill in the sequence counting in 2s, 5s, 10s
2. Equal Groups: Draw 4 groups of 3 stars
3. Arrays: Complete the array and write the total
4. Repeated Addition: Write 3 × 5 as 5 + 5 + 5 = ___
