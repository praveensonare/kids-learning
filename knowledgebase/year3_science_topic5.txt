Year 3 Science - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 5: Forces and Magnets

Contact forces:
- Push and pull
- Friction: opposes movement, creates heat
- Surfaces: rough surfaces have more friction

Magnetic forces:
- Attract: magnetic materials (iron, steel, nickel, cobalt)
- Repel: like poles push apart (N-N or S-S)
- Attract: unlike poles pull together (N-S)
- Magnetic field: area around magnet
- Uses: fridge magnets, compasses, speakers

Poles:
- North and South poles
- Compass needle points North
- Earth is a giant magnet

Investigations:
- Test which materials are magnetic
- Test strength of different magnets
- Make electromagnets

Worksheets and Activities:
1. Plant experiments and growth diaries
2. Food group sorting and meal planning
3. Skeleton labeling and joint movement
4. Rock and soil testing
5. Shadow investigations at different times
6. Mirror reflection experiments
7. Magnet strength testing
8. Scientific enquiry planning sheets
