Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 7: Time

Theory: We measure time to organize our lives and understand duration.

Telling Time:
- O'clock: 3:00 (hour hand on 3, minute hand on 12)
- Half past: 3:30 (hour hand between 3 and 4, minute hand on 6)
- Quarter past: 3:15 (minute hand on 3)
- Quarter to: 2:45 (minute hand on 9, one before hour)
- 5-minute intervals: 3:05, 3:10, 3:15, etc.

Duration:
- Minutes in an hour: 60
- Hours in a day: 24
- Days in a week: 7
- Months in a year: 12
- Days in a year: 365 (366 leap year)

Time Calculations:
- Start 2:00, end 3:00 = 1 hour
- Start 3:15, end 3:45 = 30 minutes
- 2 hours after 10:00 = 12:00

Calendar:
- Days of week: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- Months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
- Yesterday, today, tomorrow
- Last week, this week, next week

Worksheets:
1. Draw Clock Hands: Show times to 5 minutes
2. Time Intervals: How long from 2:15 to 3:00?
3. Calendar Questions: What day is 3 days after Wednesday?
