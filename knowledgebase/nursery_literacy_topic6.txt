TOPIC 6: Rhyming and Word Families

Theory: Rhyming words end with the same sound. Recognizing rhymes helps children hear patterns in language and prepares them for reading word families.

Rhyming Families:
- -at family: cat, hat, mat, sat, rat
- -an family: can, man, pan, fan, ran
- -ig family: big, dig, pig, wig, jig
- -op family: top, hop, mop, pop, stop

Examples:
- "Hickory Dickory Dock" (clock/dock rhyme)
- "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" (are/star rhyme)
- "Does cat rhyme with hat?" (Yes!)
- "Find a word that rhymes with dog" (log, fog, jog)

Worksheets:
1. Rhyme Time: Circle pictures that rhyme (hen-pen, fox-box)
2. Odd One Out: Cross out the picture that doesn't rhyme
3. Rhyme Match: Draw lines connecting rhyming pairs
4. Make a Rhyme: Think of words that rhyme with "sun"
