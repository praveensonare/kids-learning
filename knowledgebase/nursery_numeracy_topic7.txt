- Under/Over: cat is under the table
- Next to/Beside: book is next to the pencil
- In front/Behind: I'm in front of you
- Top/Bottom: hat on top, shoes on bottom

Examples:
- Put the cup on the table
- The dog is under the bed
- Stand behind your chair
- The star is on top of the tree
- Put your hand in the box
