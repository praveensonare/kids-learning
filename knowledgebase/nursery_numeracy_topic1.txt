Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Counting to 10

Theory: Counting is the foundation of all mathematics. One-to-one correspondence means matching one number word to one object. The last number counted tells us how many objects there are in total (cardinality).

Counting Principles:
- Point to each object as you count
- Count each object only once
- The order doesn't matter (5 balls is always 5)
- The last number tells the total
- Zero means none or nothing

Examples:
- Count 5 teddy bears: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Count fingers on one hand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Count backward from 5: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off!
- "How many apples?" Point and count: 1, 2, 3 (three apples)

Worksheets:
1. Count and Circle: Count the objects and circle the correct number
2. Dot-to-Dot: Connect dots in number order 1-10
3. How Many: Count objects in each group and write the number
4. Number Hunt: Find and color all the number 3's
