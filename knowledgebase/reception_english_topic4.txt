TOPIC 4: Writing - Letter Formation

Theory: Correct letter formation ensures legible handwriting. Letters should be formed consistently, starting at the correct point.

Letter Families:
- Round letters: c, o, a, d, g, q (start at 2 o'clock)
- Long letters: l, t, h, b, k, f (start at the top)
- Descenders: g, j, p, q, y (go below the line)
- Zigzag letters: k, v, w, x, z

Examples:
- Letter 'a': Round, up, down, flick
- Letter 't': Down, lift, cross
- Letter 'g': Round, up, down, curl

Worksheets:
1. Letter Families: Practice all the round letters c, o, a, d, g, q
2. Join the Dots: Follow numbered dots to form letter 's'
3. Rainbow Letters: Write letter 'a' five times in different colors
4. Name Writing: Write your first name neatly on the line
