Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 7: Geometry - 2D and 3D Shapes

Theory: Shapes have properties that help us identify and describe them.

2D Shapes Properties:
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 vertices (corners)
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
- Rectangle: 4 sides (opposite sides equal), 4 right angles
- Circle: curved, no sides, no vertices
- Pentagon: 5 sides, 5 vertices
- Hexagon: 6 sides, 6 vertices

3D Shapes Properties:
- Cube: 6 square faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Sphere: 1 curved surface, no edges, no vertices
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, 1 curved surface
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex, 1 curved surface
- Pyramid: triangular faces, 1 base, pointed top

Worksheets:
1. Name the Shape: Identify shapes and write their names
2. Properties Table: Complete a chart of sides, vertices, faces
3. Shape Sorting: Group shapes by number of sides
4. Real World: Find examples of shapes in the classroom
