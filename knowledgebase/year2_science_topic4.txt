Year 2 Science - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 4: Uses of Everyday Materials

Theory: Materials have properties that make them suitable for specific uses. We can change materials in different ways.

Material Properties and Uses:
- Waterproof: plastic (raincoats, umbrellas, bottles)
- Transparent: glass (windows, glasses, jars)
- Flexible: rubber (elastic bands, tyres, hoses)
- Hard: metal (tools, nails, screws, cars)
- Soft: fabric (cushions, clothes, curtains)
- Strong: wood (furniture, buildings, pencils)

How Materials Change:
- Squashing: playdough, sponge, bread
- Bending: wire, plastic ruler, card
- Twisting: cloth, wire, rope
- Stretching: elastic, rubber band, spring
- Some change permanently (bread squashed)
- Some return to original shape (sponge, elastic)

Suitability of Materials:
- Why is metal good for saucepans? (hard, strong, conducts heat)
- Why is glass good for windows? (transparent, waterproof)
- Why is wood good for furniture? (strong, hard, can be shaped)
- Why is plastic good for toys? (colorful, light, strong, safe)

Recycling:
- Reuse materials instead of throwing away
- Glass, plastic, paper, metal can be recycled
- Reduces waste, saves resources, helps environment

Worksheets:
1. Material Properties: Test and record material properties
2. Best Material: Choose suitable materials for different objects
3. Change Investigation: Test which materials can be squashed/bent/stretched
4. Recycling Sort: Which bin does each item go in?
