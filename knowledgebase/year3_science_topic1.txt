Year 3 Science - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Plants

Plant structure and functions:
- Roots: absorb water and nutrients, anchor plant
- Stem: transport water, support
- Leaves: photosynthesis (light + CO₂ + water → glucose + oxygen)
- Flowers: reproduction, attract pollinators

Requirements for growth:
- Water, light, suitable temperature, nutrients
- Investigation: vary conditions, measure growth

Water transportation:
- Observe celery in colored water
- Water travels up stem to leaves
- Transpiration: water evaporates from leaves

Life cycles:
- Seed → germination → seedling → mature plant → flowering → seed production
