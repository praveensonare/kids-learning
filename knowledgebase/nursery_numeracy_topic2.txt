Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 2: Number Recognition and Formation

Theory: Numbers are symbols that represent quantities. Each numeral (0, 1, 2, 3...) has a specific name and shape. Learning to recognize and write numbers helps children communicate mathematically.

Number Formation:
- 0: Round circle (zero is nothing)
- 1: Straight down (one line)
- 2: Around and slide (like a swan)
- 3: Around and around (two humps)
- 4: Down, across, down (like a chair)
- 5: Down, around, hat on top

Examples:
- Number 1 looks like a candle
- Number 2 looks like a swan
- Number 3 looks like two bumps
- Find number 5 on a clock
- Write your age using a number

Worksheets:
1. Number Tracing: Trace over dotted numbers 0-10
2. Number Match: Match number to the correct group of objects
3. Number Hunt: Circle all the 4's in the picture
4. Write Numbers: Copy numbers 1-5
