Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 5: 2D and 3D Shapes

Theory: Shapes are all around us. 2D shapes are flat with sides and corners. 3D shapes are solid objects we can hold. Learning about shapes helps children describe and understand the world.

2D Shapes:
- Circle: round, no corners, no straight sides
- Triangle: 3 straight sides, 3 corners
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 corners
- Rectangle: 4 sides (2 long, 2 short), 4 corners

3D Shapes:
- Sphere: ball shape, rolls
- Cube: box with square faces
- Cylinder: tube shape, can roll
- Cone: ice cream cone shape, pointy top

Examples:
- Circle: plate, clock, wheel, pizza
- Square: window, picture frame, cracker
- Sphere: ball, orange, globe
- Cylinder: tin can, paper towel roll

Worksheets:
1. Shape Sort: Group shapes by type (all circles together)
2. Shape Hunt: Find and color all the triangles
3. Shape Trace: Trace around shape templates
4. Real World Shapes: Match shapes to real objects
