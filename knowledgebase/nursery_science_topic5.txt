TOPIC 5: Weather and Seasons

Theory: Weather is what it's like outside each day. It changes daily and throughout the year. There are four seasons with different weather patterns.

Types of Weather:
- Sunny: bright, warm, clear sky, need sunglasses, wear shorts
- Rainy: wet, clouds, need umbrella and raincoat, puddles
- Windy: air moving, trees blow, fly kites, leaves blow
- Snowy: cold, white snow falls, build snowman, wear warm coat
- Cloudy: grey sky, no sun visible
- Stormy: thunder, lightning, heavy rain, very windy

Four Seasons:
- Spring: flowers bloom, baby animals born, warmer, trees get leaves
- Summer: hot, sunny, long days, go to beach, wear light clothes
- Autumn/Fall: leaves change color and fall, cooler, harvest time
- Winter: cold, short days, may snow, animals hibernate, wear warm clothes

Worksheets:
1. Weather Matching: Match weather to correct clothes (sun → shorts, rain → umbrella)
2. Season Sort: Group pictures into the four seasons
3. Weather Chart: Record today's weather each day for a week (sunny/rainy/cloudy)
4. What Can I Do?: Match activities to weather (make snowman = snowy, swim = sunny)
