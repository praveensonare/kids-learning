Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 7: 2D and 3D Shapes

Theory: 2D shapes are flat with sides and corners. 3D shapes are solid with faces, edges, and vertices.

Examples:
2D Shapes:
- Circle: round, 0 sides, 0 corners
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 corners
- Square: 4 equal sides, 4 corners
- Rectangle: 4 sides (2 long, 2 short), 4 corners
- Pentagon: 5 sides, 5 corners
- Hexagon: 6 sides, 6 corners

3D Shapes:
- Sphere: ball-shaped, rolls
- Cube: 6 square faces
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces (box)
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, rolls
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex, rolls
- Pyramid: triangular faces, pointed top

Worksheets:
1. Shape Properties: Count the sides and corners of each shape
2. Shape Sort: Group shapes by number of sides
3. 3D Shape Hunt: Find objects that are cubes, spheres, cylinders
4. Shape Patterns: Continue the pattern (triangle, circle, triangle...)
