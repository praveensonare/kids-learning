TOPIC 3: Animals Including Humans

Theory: Animals need food, water, and air. They have offspring which grow into adults. We must care for our bodies.

Basic Needs:
- Food: energy and nutrients
- Water: stay hydrated, bodies need water
- Air: breathe oxygen
- Shelter: protection from weather and predators

Offspring (babies):
- Mammals: give birth to live young (kittens, puppies, calves, babies)
- Birds: lay eggs, keep warm, chicks hatch
- Amphibians: lay eggs in water, tadpoles → frogs
- Reptiles: most lay eggs, baby looks like mini adult
- Insects: eggs → larva → pupa → adult (metamorphosis)

Growth:
- Baby → child → teenager → adult → elderly
- Animals grow and change as they get older
- Need right food and care to grow healthily

Staying Healthy:
- Balanced diet: fruits, vegetables, proteins, carbs, dairy
- Exercise: 60 minutes daily for children, makes strong
- Hygiene: wash hands, brush teeth, shower, clean clothes
- Sleep: 10-11 hours for children aged 6-13
- Water: 6-8 glasses daily

Worksheets:
1. Life Cycles: Arrange pictures showing animal growth stages
2. Food Groups: Sort foods into groups, plan balanced meal
3. Exercise Diary: Record physical activities for one week
4. Hygiene Checklist: Daily habits for staying clean and healthy
