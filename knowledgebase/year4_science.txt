Year 4 Science - Cambridge Primary Standards

Learning Objectives: Set up comparative tests, observe over time, gather/record data, use scientific evidence

Key Topics:
TOPIC 1: Living Things/Habitats: Classification keys, environmental changes affect living things, construct food chains (producers, predators, prey)
TOPIC 2: Animals/Humans: Digestion (mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines), teeth types (incisors, canines, molars), food chains, healthy eating
TOPIC 3: States of Matter: Solids, liquids, gases; particles; melting, freezing, evaporating, condensing; water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation); temperature effects
TOPIC 4: Sound: Vibrations travel through medium, pitch (high/low), volume (loud/quiet), sound travels differently through materials, patterns between pitch/volume and vibration
TOPIC 5: Electricity: Simple circuits, cells, wires, bulbs, switches, buzzers; complete circuit needed; conductors and insulators; common appliances use electricity
Worksheets: Classification activities, digestion diagrams, states of matter experiments, sound investigations, circuit building
