Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 6: Geometry - 2D and 3D Shapes

Theory: Shapes have specific properties that help us identify and classify them.

2D Shape Properties:
- Sides: straight edges
- Vertices: corners/points where sides meet
- Right angles: square corners (90°)
- Lines of symmetry: where shape can fold in half

Common 2D Shapes:
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 vertices
- Quadrilaterals: 4 sides, 4 vertices
  * Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
  * Rectangle: opposite sides equal, 4 right angles
  * Rhombus: 4 equal sides, opposite angles equal
- Pentagon: 5 sides
- Hexagon: 6 sides
- Octagon: 8 sides
- Circle: curved edge, no vertices

3D Shape Properties:
- Faces: flat surfaces
- Edges: where two faces meet
- Vertices: points where edges meet

Common 3D Shapes:
- Cube: 6 square faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Sphere: 1 curved surface
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, 1 curved surface
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex
- Pyramid: triangular faces, 1 base

Worksheets:
1. Properties Table: List properties of shapes
2. Symmetry: Draw lines of symmetry on shapes
3. 3D Nets: Which nets fold to make cube?
4. Shape Hunt: Find and photograph shapes in school
