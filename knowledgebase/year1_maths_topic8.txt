Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 8: Measurement

Theory: We measure to find out how long, heavy, or much something is. We use units and tools to measure accurately.

Length:
- Non-standard units: cubes, hands, paperclips
- Standard units: centimeters (cm), meters (m)
- Measuring tools: ruler, tape measure
- Compare: longer, shorter, taller, same length

Weight/Mass:
- Non-standard: compare which is heavier
- Standard units: kilograms (kg)
- Measuring tools: balance scales, weighing scales
- Compare: heavier, lighter, same weight

Capacity/Volume:
- How much a container holds
- Standard units: liters (l), milliliters (ml)
- Compare: full, empty, half full, more, less

Worksheets:
1. Measure It: Use a ruler to measure lines in cm
2. Comparing Weight: Which is heavier - book or pencil?
3. Capacity: Order containers by how much they hold
4. Estimation: Estimate then measure the length of your desk
