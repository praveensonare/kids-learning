TOPIC 4: Materials, Properties, and Changes

Theory: Materials are what objects are made from. They have different properties. Some materials can change when heated, cooled, or mixed.

Material Properties:
- Transparent: see through (glass, clear plastic, water)
- Opaque: cannot see through (wood, metal, thick paper)
- Flexible: bends easily (rubber, fabric, paper)
- Rigid: doesn't bend (wood, metal, hard plastic)
- Waterproof: water runs off (plastic, rubber, metal)
- Absorbent: soaks up water (sponge, paper towel, fabric)
- Magnetic: attracted to magnets (iron, steel, some metals)
- Non-magnetic: not attracted (wood, plastic, aluminum, copper)

Changing Materials:
- Melting: solid to liquid (ice → water, chocolate melts when warm)
- Freezing: liquid to solid (water → ice in freezer)
- Dissolving: solid disappears in liquid (sugar in tea, salt in water)
- Mixing: combine ingredients (flour + water = dough)
- Heating: changes food (raw egg → cooked egg, bread → toast)
- Evaporation: liquid to gas (puddle dries up, wet clothes dry)

Reversible vs Irreversible:
- Reversible: can change back (melt ice → freeze again, dissolve salt → evaporate water)
- Irreversible: cannot change back (bake cake, burn wood, cook egg)

Worksheets:
1. Property Testing: Test materials for waterproof, transparent, magnetic, flexible
2. Which Material?: Choose best material for umbrella, window, toy, spoon
3. Melting Investigation: Predict which materials melt (ice, chocolate, wax vs rock, wood, metal)
4. Dissolving Test: Which things dissolve in water? (sugar, salt vs sand, rice)
