3. Homophone Choice: Choose correct homophone in sentences
4. Silent Letter Hunt: Circle the silent letter in each word

TOPIC 2: Reading Comprehension and Inference
Theory: Good readers make inferences by using clues in the text plus their own knowledge to understand deeper meanings.

Comprehension Skills:
- Literal understanding: Find information directly stated
- Inference: Work out what's implied but not said
- Prediction: Use clues to guess what happens next
- Cause and effect: Understand why things happen
- Character feelings: Infer how characters feel and why
- Vocabulary in context: Work out word meanings from context

Question Types:
- Find and copy: "Find and copy two words that describe..."
- Why?: "Why did the character...?"
- How do you know?: "How do you know the character was sad?"
- What does this word mean?: Vocabulary in context
- Summarize: "What happened in this part?"

Example Text:
"Mia dragged her feet as she walked to school. She had forgotten to do her homework again. Her tummy felt funny and her hands were shaking as she reached the classroom door."

Inferences:
- Mia is worried/nervous (tummy funny, shaking hands)
- She's in trouble (forgot homework)
- She doesn't want to go to school (dragging feet)

Worksheets:
1. Inference Practice: Read short texts, answer "How do you know?" questions
2. Character Feelings: Identify feelings and find evidence
3. Cause and Effect: Match causes to their effects
4. Predict: Read part of story, predict ending, check if correct

TOPIC 3: Grammar - Sentence Types and Tenses
Theory: Different sentence types serve different purposes. Verbs change form to show when something happened.

Sentence Types:
- Statement: tells information (The cat sat on the mat.)
- Question: asks something (Where is the cat?)
- Command: gives instruction (Sit down. Be quiet.)
- Exclamation: shows strong feeling (What a big cat!)

Punctuation:
- Full stop (.): end of statement
- Question mark (?): end of question
- Exclamation mark (!): end of exclamation or command showing excitement
- Comma (,): separate items in list (I bought apples, oranges, bananas and grapes.)
- Apostrophe ('): contraction (do not → don't, I am → I'm)

Present Tense vs Past Tense:
- Present: happening now (I walk, she runs, they play)
- Past: already happened (I walked, she ran, they played)
- Progressive: -ing shows ongoing (I am walking, she was running)

Regular vs Irregular Past Tense:
- Regular: add -ed (walk → walked, play → played)
- Irregular: changes completely (run → ran, go → went, see → saw, eat → ate)

Worksheets:
1. Sentence Types: Label each sentence as statement, question, command, or exclamation
2. Add Punctuation: Put correct punctuation at end of sentences
3. Tense Change: Rewrite sentences changing from present to past
4. Apostrophe Practice: Write contractions for word pairs (cannot → can't)
