TOPIC 2: Plants

Theory: Plants are essential for life. They grow from seeds and have specific needs.

What Plants Need to Stay Healthy:
- Light: photosynthesis, makes food
- Water: for growth, keeps plant firm
- Suitable temperature: not too hot or cold
- Space: room to grow

How Seeds Disperse:
- Wind: dandelion, sycamore (lightweight, parachutes, wings)
- Animals: burrs stick to fur, fruit eaten then seeds dropped
- Water: coconut floats to new places
- Explosion: pea pods burst open, shoots seeds out

Seed to Plant Investigation:
- Plant beans/cress in different conditions
- Test: no water, no light, no warmth, perfect conditions
- Observe differences in growth
- Record with photos and measurements

Parts and Their Jobs:
- Roots: anchor plant, absorb water and nutrients
- Stem: support, transport water and nutrients
- Leaves: make food through photosynthesis, breathe
- Flower: reproduction, attract insects, make seeds
- Seeds: contain baby plant, food store, grow into new plant

Worksheets:
1. Plant Needs Experiment: Record plant growth in different conditions
2. Seed Dispersal: Match seeds to their dispersal method
3. Label Diagram: Parts of a flowering plant
4. Growth Diary: Measure and record bean plant weekly
