Nursery Science - Discovery and Exploration

Learning Objectives:
- Explore the natural world through observation and investigation
- Develop curiosity about living things, materials, and physical phenomena
- Learn to ask questions and make predictions
- Use all five senses to investigate objects and materials
- Understand basic concepts about animals, plants, and the environment
- Develop scientific vocabulary through hands-on experiences

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Living Things - Animals
Theory: Animals are living things that move, eat, grow, and have babies. Different animals live in different places (habitats) and have special features that help them survive.

Examples:
- Pets: dogs, cats, rabbits, fish, hamsters
- Farm animals: cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, horses
- Wild animals: lions, elephants, monkeys, bears
- Birds: sparrows, pigeons, ducks, owls
- Minibeasts: butterflies, ladybirds, worms, snails, ants

Animal Features:
- Dogs have 4 legs, fur, a tail, and bark
- Birds have 2 legs, feathers, wings, and lay eggs
- Fish have fins, scales, and live in water
- Insects have 6 legs and some can fly

Worksheets:
1. Animal Sorting: Group animals by number of legs (2, 4, 6, 8, no legs)
2. Where Do I Live?: Match animals to their homes (bird-nest, fish-pond, dog-kennel)
3. Animal Babies: Match adult animals to their babies (cat-kitten, dog-puppy)
4. What Do I Eat?: Sort animals into groups (meat eaters, plant eaters)

TOPIC 2: Living Things - Plants
Theory: Plants are living things that grow from seeds. They need water, light, and soil to grow. Plants give us food and make the air clean.

Parts of a Plant:
- Roots: underground, take in water and nutrients
- Stem: holds the plant up, carries water
- Leaves: green, make food for the plant, need sunlight
- Flowers: colorful, make seeds
- Seeds: grow into new plants

Examples:
- Trees: oak, apple, pine (tall plants with thick stems called trunks)
- Flowers: sunflower, rose, daisy, tulip
- Vegetables: carrot, potato, lettuce, tomato
- Fruits: apple, banana, orange, strawberry

Worksheets:
1. Label the Plant: Point to roots, stem, leaves, flower on a picture
2. Plant Needs: Circle what plants need to grow (water, light, soil vs. toys, TV)
3. Fruit or Vegetable?: Sort pictures into fruits and vegetables
4. Growing Sequence: Put pictures in order (seed → sprout → plant → flower)

TOPIC 3: Our Bodies and Senses
Theory: We have five senses that help us explore the world. Our bodies have different parts that do different jobs.

The Five Senses:
1. Sight (eyes): We see colors, shapes, light, dark
2. Hearing (ears): We hear sounds - loud, quiet, high, low
3. Touch (skin/hands): We feel textures - soft, hard, smooth, rough, hot, cold
4. Taste (tongue): We taste flavors - sweet, salty, sour, bitter
5. Smell (nose): We smell scents - nice, nasty, flowers, food

Body Parts:
- Head: brain (thinks), eyes (see), ears (hear), nose (smell), mouth (taste/eat)
- Arms and hands: reach, hold, touch, write
- Legs and feet: walk, run, jump, kick
- Heart: pumps blood around body
- Tummy: digests food

Worksheets:
1. Which Sense?: Match activities to senses (looking at book = sight, eating apple = taste)
2. Body Parts: Label head, arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, nose, mouth on outline
3. Texture Hunt: Find and draw things that are soft, hard, smooth, rough
4. Keeping Healthy: Circle healthy choices (fruit, exercise, washing hands)

TOPIC 4: Materials and Their Properties
Theory: Everything is made of materials. Materials have different properties (how they look and feel). We choose materials based on what we need them to do.

Common Materials:
- Wood: hard, strong, from trees (furniture, pencils, buildings)
- Metal: hard, shiny, strong, can be cold (spoons, cars, coins)
- Plastic: light, waterproof, bendy or hard (toys, bottles, bags)
- Glass: transparent, hard, breakable (windows, mirrors, bottles)
- Fabric/Cloth: soft, flexible, can be colorful (clothes, curtains, bags)
- Paper: thin, light, tears easily (books, newspapers, tissues)
- Rubber: bendy, stretchy, waterproof (boots, tyres, balls)

Properties:
- Hard or soft: table is hard, pillow is soft
- Rough or smooth: sandpaper is rough, glass is smooth
- Shiny or dull: mirror is shiny, brick is dull
- Transparent or opaque: window is transparent, wall is opaque
- Waterproof or absorbent: raincoat is waterproof, towel is absorbent

Worksheets:
1. Material Hunt: Find 3 things made of wood, plastic, metal
2. Property Sorting: Group objects by properties (hard/soft, rough/smooth)
3. Best Material: What material for a raincoat? A window? A teddy bear?
4. Sink or Float?: Predict which objects will sink or float in water

TOPIC 5: Weather and Seasons
Theory: Weather is what it's like outside each day. It changes daily and throughout the year. There are four seasons with different weather patterns.

Types of Weather:
- Sunny: bright, warm, clear sky, need sunglasses, wear shorts
- Rainy: wet, clouds, need umbrella and raincoat, puddles
- Windy: air moving, trees blow, fly kites, leaves blow
- Snowy: cold, white snow falls, build snowman, wear warm coat
- Cloudy: grey sky, no sun visible
- Stormy: thunder, lightning, heavy rain, very windy

Four Seasons:
- Spring: flowers bloom, baby animals born, warmer, trees get leaves
- Summer: hot, sunny, long days, go to beach, wear light clothes
- Autumn/Fall: leaves change color and fall, cooler, harvest time
- Winter: cold, short days, may snow, animals hibernate, wear warm clothes

Worksheets:
1. Weather Matching: Match weather to correct clothes (sun → shorts, rain → umbrella)
2. Season Sort: Group pictures into the four seasons
3. Weather Chart: Record today's weather each day for a week (sunny/rainy/cloudy)
4. What Can I Do?: Match activities to weather (make snowman = snowy, swim = sunny)

TOPIC 6: Day and Night
Theory: Earth spins, giving us day and night. During the day it's light because we can see the sun. At night it's dark and we can see the moon and stars.

Day Time:
- Light outside because of the sun
- Sky is blue or cloudy
- We can see clearly
- Most people are awake
- Day activities: school, playing, eating lunch

Night Time:
- Dark outside, sun has gone down
- Sky is black, we see moon and stars
- Need lights to see inside
- Most people sleep
- Night activities: sleeping, bedtime story, dreaming

Worksheets:
1. Day or Night?: Sort pictures of activities into day time and night time
2. Draw the Sky: Draw daytime sky (blue, sun, clouds) and night sky (dark, moon, stars)
3. My Day: Draw what you do in the morning, afternoon, and night
4. Moon Shapes: Look at the moon each night and draw its shape

TOPIC 7: Forces and Movement
Theory: Forces make things move, stop, or change direction. We use pushes and pulls every day.

Push and Pull:
- Push: move something away from you (push a swing, push a toy car, push a door open)
- Pull: move something toward you (pull a wagon, pull a drawer open, pull a rope)
- Both: opening a drawer (pull), closing it (push)

Types of Movement:
- Rolling: wheels, balls, cylinders roll
- Sliding: smooth surfaces let things slide
- Bouncing: balls bounce up and down
- Spinning: tops, wheels, merry-go-round spin round
- Floating: boats, ducks, leaves float on water
- Sinking: heavy things sink to the bottom

Fast and Slow:
- Car is fast, snail is slow
- Cheetah is fast, tortoise is slow
- Rocket is very fast, person walking is slow

Worksheets:
1. Push or Pull?: Circle if you push or pull to use each object
2. Ramp Races: Which toy car rolls fastest down a ramp?
3. Will It Roll?: Predict which shapes will roll (ball, cube, cylinder)
4. Fast or Slow?: Sort animals and vehicles by how fast they move

Sample Activities:
- Nature Walks: Observe plants, animals, weather outdoors
- Planting Seeds: Grow cress or beans in classroom
- Sense Boxes: Mystery boxes with objects to feel, smell, or hear
- Floating and Sinking: Test which objects float in water tray
- Magnet Exploration: Use magnets to find what attracts
- Ice Melting: Watch ice melt, discuss where water went
- Shadow Play: Make shadows with flashlight
- Weather Station: Record daily weather with pictures
- Animal Visitors: Observe pets or small animals safely
- Material Sorting: Sort objects by material (wood, plastic, metal)
- Seasonal Tree: Observe same tree through all four seasons
- Cooking Activities: Mix, melt, change materials

- Describes simple properties of materials
- Recognizes different types of weather
- Understands difference between day and night
- Demonstrates push and pull with objects
- Shows curiosity and asks questions
