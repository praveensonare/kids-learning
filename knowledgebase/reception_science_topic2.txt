TOPIC 2: Plants and Growth

Theory: Plants are living things that grow from seeds. They need water, light, air, and nutrients from soil. Plants make their own food using sunlight.

Plant Life Cycle:
1. Seed: planted in soil
2. Germination: seed sprouts roots down, shoot up
3. Seedling: small plant grows
4. Adult plant: fully grown, makes flowers
5. Flowering: flowers attract bees
6. Fruit/seeds: new seeds form, spread, cycle repeats

What Plants Need:
- Water: to drink and stay alive
- Light: from sun to make food
- Air: to breathe
- Soil: for nutrients and to hold roots
- Space: to grow bigger
- Warmth: to grow well

Parts and Jobs:
- Roots: anchor plant, absorb water and nutrients
- Stem: support, transport water up
- Leaves: make food using sunlight (photosynthesis)
- Flowers: attract insects, make seeds
- Seeds: grow into new plants

Worksheets:
1. Plant Diary: Draw your bean plant each week as it grows
2. What's Missing?: Show plants with missing needs (no water/light) and predict what happens
3. Parts and Jobs: Match plant parts to their functions
4. Edible Plants: Sort foods by plant part (roots: carrot, leaves: lettuce, fruit: apple, seeds: peas)
