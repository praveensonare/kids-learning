Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Place Value to 100

Theory: Understanding that the position of a digit determines its value is crucial for all mathematics.

Place Value Concepts:
- Tens and Ones: 45 = 4 tens (40) + 5 ones (5)
- Partitioning: Breaking numbers (67 = 60 + 7)
- Comparing: 56 > 43, 28 < 31
- Ordering: 12, 25, 34, 47, 89 (ascending)
- Estimating: About 50, nearly 100

Number Line Skills:
- Count in steps: 2s, 5s, 10s
- Find number between: What's between 34 and 36? (35)
- Round to nearest 10: 47 rounds to 50

Examples:
- 73 = 70 + 3 = 7 tens and 3 ones
- Compare: 45 < 54 (look at tens first)
- Round: 34 → 30, 36 → 40 (nearest 10)

Worksheets:
1. Place Value Grid: Write numbers in tens and ones
2. Partitioning: Break numbers in different ways (42 = 40 + 2 = 30 + 12)
3. Ordering: Arrange 6 numbers from smallest to largest
4. Estimating: Estimate positions on number line
