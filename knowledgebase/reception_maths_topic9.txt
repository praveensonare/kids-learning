Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 9: Time

Theory: We measure time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. Clocks help us tell the time.

Examples:
- Days of the week: Monday, Tuesday... Sunday (7 days)
- Months: January, February... December (12 months)
- O'clock: The long hand points to 12, short hand shows the hour
- Half past: The long hand points to 6
- Yesterday, today, tomorrow
- Morning, afternoon, evening, night

Worksheets:
1. Days of the Week: Put the days in order
2. Time Matching: Match clock faces to times (3 o'clock, 7 o'clock)
3. Daily Routine: When do you eat breakfast? (morning)
4. Duration: Circle activities that take a long time
