Year 3 Science - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Ask relevant questions and set up simple tests
- Make systematic observations and measurements
- Gather, record, and present data
- Use evidence to answer questions
- Identify differences and similarities
- Use scientific vocabulary

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Plants
Plant structure and functions:
- Roots: absorb water and nutrients, anchor plant
- Stem: transport water, support
- Leaves: photosynthesis (light + CO₂ + water → glucose + oxygen)
- Flowers: reproduction, attract pollinators

Requirements for growth:
- Water, light, suitable temperature, nutrients
- Investigation: vary conditions, measure growth

Water transportation:
- Observe celery in colored water
- Water travels up stem to leaves
- Transpiration: water evaporates from leaves

Life cycles:
- Seed → germination → seedling → mature plant → flowering → seed production

TOPIC 2: Animals Including Humans
Nutrition:
- Balanced diet: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals
- Food groups and their roles
- Plan healthy meals

Skeleton and muscles:
- Skeleton: support, protection, movement
- Major bones: skull, ribs, spine, pelvis, femur
- Joints: where bones meet, allow movement
- Muscles: work in pairs, contract and relax
- Investigation: measure strength, flexibility

TOPIC 3: Rocks and Soils
Types of rocks:
- Igneous: formed from lava/magma (granite, basalt)
- Sedimentary: layers compressed over time (sandstone, limestone, chalk)
- Metamorphic: changed by heat/pressure (marble, slate)

Properties:
- Hard or soft
- Permeable (water passes through) or impermeable
- Texture: smooth, rough, grainy

Soil formation:
- Weathering breaks down rocks
- Organic matter (dead plants/animals) mixes in
- Different soil types: sandy, clay, loamy

Fossils:
- Remains of prehistoric plants/animals preserved in rock
- Tell us about past life

TOPIC 4: Light and Shadows
Light sources:
- Sun, fire, light bulbs, screens, glow sticks
- Moon and planets reflect light (not sources)

Reflection:
- Light bounces off shiny surfaces
- Mirrors reflect light
- Angles of incidence and reflection

Shadows:
- Formed when opaque object blocks light
- Shadow shape matches object
- Size depends on distance from light source
- Sun creates shadows at different positions throughout day

Danger:
- Never look directly at sun
- Can damage eyes permanently

TOPIC 5: Forces and Magnets
Contact forces:
- Push and pull
- Friction: opposes movement, creates heat
- Surfaces: rough surfaces have more friction

Magnetic forces:
- Attract: magnetic materials (iron, steel, nickel, cobalt)
- Repel: like poles push apart (N-N or S-S)
- Attract: unlike poles pull together (N-S)
- Magnetic field: area around magnet
- Uses: fridge magnets, compasses, speakers

Poles:
- North and South poles
- Compass needle points North
- Earth is a giant magnet

Investigations:
- Test which materials are magnetic
- Test strength of different magnets
- Make electromagnets

Worksheets and Activities:
1. Plant experiments and growth diaries
2. Food group sorting and meal planning
3. Skeleton labeling and joint movement
4. Rock and soil testing
5. Shadow investigations at different times
6. Mirror reflection experiments
7. Magnet strength testing
8. Scientific enquiry planning sheets
