Reception Science - Exploring the World Around Us
TOPIC 6: Light and Dark

Theory: Light lets us see. It travels in straight lines from sources. Shadows form when light is blocked.

Light Sources:
- Natural: sun (biggest), stars, moon (reflects sunlight), fire, lightning
- Artificial: light bulbs, candles, torches, screens, glow sticks, lamps

Light Behaviors:
- Travels in straight lines: cannot bend around corners
- Reflects: bounces off shiny surfaces (mirrors, water, metal)
- Transparent materials: light passes through (glass, clear plastic, water)
- Translucent materials: some light passes through (tissue paper, frosted glass)
- Opaque materials: light blocked (wood, metal, thick fabric)

Shadows:
- Form when object blocks light
- Shadow on opposite side from light source
- Bigger shadow: light source closer or object bigger
- Smaller shadow: light source farther or object smaller
- No shadow without light

Day and Night:
- Earth spins (rotates) once every 24 hours
- Day: our side faces the sun (light)
- Night: our side faces away from sun (dark)
- Moon visible at night (reflects sun's light)
- Different times around the world

Worksheets:
1. Light Sources: Circle things that make light
2. Shadow Investigation: Draw shadows at different times of day
3. Transparent Test: Sort materials by how much light passes through
4. Safety: Never look directly at the sun - why?
