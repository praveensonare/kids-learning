TOPIC 4: Materials and Their Properties

Theory: Everything is made of materials. Materials have different properties (how they look and feel). We choose materials based on what we need them to do.

Common Materials:
- Wood: hard, strong, from trees (furniture, pencils, buildings)
- Metal: hard, shiny, strong, can be cold (spoons, cars, coins)
- Plastic: light, waterproof, bendy or hard (toys, bottles, bags)
- Glass: transparent, hard, breakable (windows, mirrors, bottles)
- Fabric/Cloth: soft, flexible, can be colorful (clothes, curtains, bags)
- Paper: thin, light, tears easily (books, newspapers, tissues)
- Rubber: bendy, stretchy, waterproof (boots, tyres, balls)

Properties:
- Hard or soft: table is hard, pillow is soft
- Rough or smooth: sandpaper is rough, glass is smooth
- Shiny or dull: mirror is shiny, brick is dull
- Transparent or opaque: window is transparent, wall is opaque
- Waterproof or absorbent: raincoat is waterproof, towel is absorbent

Worksheets:
1. Material Hunt: Find 3 things made of wood, plastic, metal
2. Property Sorting: Group objects by properties (hard/soft, rough/smooth)
3. Best Material: What material for a raincoat? A window? A teddy bear?
4. Sink or Float?: Predict which objects will sink or float in water
