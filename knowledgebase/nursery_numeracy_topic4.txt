Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 4: Comparing Quantities

Theory: Comparing helps children understand relative size and quantity. We use mathematical language like more, fewer, less, same, equal to describe and compare groups.

Comparison Language:
- More means a bigger amount
- Fewer/Less means a smaller amount
- Same/Equal means the amounts match
- Use words: bigger, smaller, longer, shorter

Examples:
- 5 apples is more than 3 apples
- 2 cars is fewer than 4 cars
- This line of 3 bears is the same as that line of 3 bears
- The red tower is taller than the blue tower

Worksheets:
1. More or Less: Circle the group that has more
2. Same Amount: Draw lines to match equal groups
3. Comparing: Color the set with fewer objects
4. Most and Least: Circle the group with the most
