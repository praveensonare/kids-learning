Reception English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Read simple CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words using phonics
- Write simple sentences with capital letters and full stops
- Develop comprehension skills through listening and discussion
- Build vocabulary through stories and conversations
- Form letters correctly with appropriate size and spacing
- Recognize high-frequency words by sight

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Phonics (Phase 2-4)
Theory: Phonics is a method of teaching reading by linking sounds (phonemes) with letters or groups of letters (graphemes). By learning these relationships, children can decode unfamiliar words.

Phase 2 Sounds: s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d, g, o, c, k, ck, e, u, r, h, b, f, l
Phase 3 Sounds: j, v, w, x, y, z, qu, ch, sh, th, ng, ai, ee, igh, oa, oo, ar, or, ur, ow, oi, ear, air, ure, er
Phase 4: Blending adjacent consonants (CCVC and CVCC words)

Examples:
- CVC words: cat, dog, sun, pin, mop
- Blending: c-a-t = cat, sh-o-p = shop
- Segmenting: fish = f-i-sh
- Phase 4: cr-a-b = crab, t-e-n-t = tent

Worksheets:
1. Sound Buttons: Put dots under each sound in the word "ship" (sh-i-p = 3 sounds)
2. Blending Practice: Read these words: sat, pit, dog, run, hug
3. Word Building: Use letter cards to make: cat, can, man, pan

TOPIC 2: High-Frequency Words (Tricky Words)
Theory: Some common words don't follow regular phonics rules and need to be learned by sight. These are called "tricky words" or "sight words."

Examples - Set 1:
- the, to, I, no, go, into, he, she, we, me, be
- was, you, they, all, are, my, her

Examples - Set 2:
- said, so, have, like, some, come, were, there, little, one, when, out, what

Worksheets:
1. Word Recognition: Circle the word "the" every time you see it in the sentence
2. Tricky Word Practice: Write "I" "the" "said" three times each
3. Missing Word: Fill in: "I ___ play." (can)
4. Sentence Reading: "I like the big dog."

TOPIC 3: Reading CVC and Simple Sentences
Theory: Reading involves decoding words by blending sounds and using picture clues. Fluent reading comes with practice.

Examples:
Simple Sentences:
- "The cat sat."
- "I can run."
- "Dad is big."
- "Look at the dog!"

Reading Strategies:
- Sound out each word
- Look at the picture for clues
- Re-read if it doesn't make sense
- Think: does that sound right?

Worksheets:
1. Read and Match: Read the sentence "The cat is fat" and draw a picture
2. Yes or No: "Can a pig fly?" (No)
3. Sentence Completion: "I can ___ fast." (run/hop/swim)
4. Comprehension: Read "Sam has a red ball. He plays in the park." Questions: Who? What? Where?

TOPIC 4: Writing - Letter Formation
Theory: Correct letter formation ensures legible handwriting. Letters should be formed consistently, starting at the correct point.

Letter Families:
- Round letters: c, o, a, d, g, q (start at 2 o'clock)
- Long letters: l, t, h, b, k, f (start at the top)
- Descenders: g, j, p, q, y (go below the line)
- Zigzag letters: k, v, w, x, z

Examples:
- Letter 'a': Round, up, down, flick
- Letter 't': Down, lift, cross
- Letter 'g': Round, up, down, curl

Worksheets:
1. Letter Families: Practice all the round letters c, o, a, d, g, q
2. Join the Dots: Follow numbered dots to form letter 's'
3. Rainbow Letters: Write letter 'a' five times in different colors
4. Name Writing: Write your first name neatly on the line

TOPIC 5: Sentence Writing
Theory: Sentences express complete thoughts. They start with capital letters, have spaces between words, and end with punctuation marks (. ! ?).

Examples:
- "I like cats." (statement - full stop)
- "Can you jump?" (question - question mark)
- "Look out!" (exclamation - exclamation mark)

Sentence Checklist:
✓ Capital letter at the start
✓ Finger spaces between words
✓ Full stop at the end
✓ Sounds right when read aloud

Worksheets:
1. Fix the Sentence: "i like dogs" → "I like dogs."
2. Sentence Building: Use word cards to make: "The dog is big."
3. Write a Sentence: Write about your favorite toy
4. Add Punctuation: Put full stops and capital letters in the right places

TOPIC 6: Story Comprehension
Theory: Comprehension means understanding what we read or hear. Good readers think about characters, settings, and events.

Story Elements:
- Characters: Who is in the story?
- Setting: Where and when does it happen?
- Beginning: How does the story start?
- Middle: What happens?
- End: How does it end?
- Problem and Solution: What goes wrong? How is it fixed?

Examples - "The Three Billy Goats Gruff":
- Characters: 3 goats, troll
- Setting: Bridge over a river
- Problem: Troll won't let goats cross
- Solution: Biggest goat pushes troll into water

Worksheets:
1. Story Map: Draw the beginning, middle, and end of "Goldilocks"
2. Character Questions: Who was kind? Who was naughty?
3. Prediction: What do you think will happen next?
4. Retelling: Put the story pictures in order 1, 2, 3, 4

TOPIC 7: Vocabulary and Language
Theory: Learning new words helps us express ideas clearly and understand complex texts.

Word Types:
- Nouns: cat, dog, house, mum
- Verbs (action words): run, jump, eat, play
- Adjectives (describing words): big, little, red, happy

Examples:
- The BIG dog (adjective)
- The dog RUNS fast (verb)
- The DOG is brown (noun)

Worksheets:
1. Adjectives: Circle the describing word in "the red car"
2. Verb Actions: Draw yourself doing these actions: jump, sit, clap
3. Noun Hunt: Find and write 5 nouns from a picture
4. Sentence Expansion: Change "I see a cat" to "I see a big black cat"

Sample Activities:
- Daily Phonics Sessions: 15-20 minutes of phonics practice
- Guided Reading: Small group reading with teacher support
- Independent Writing: Writing news, stories, labels
- Story Time: Read-aloud with discussions
- Word Games: Bingo with high-frequency words
- Role Play: Acting out stories in costume area
- Library Time: Choosing and sharing books
