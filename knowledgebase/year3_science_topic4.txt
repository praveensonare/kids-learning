TOPIC 4: Light and Shadows

Light sources:
- Sun, fire, light bulbs, screens, glow sticks
- Moon and planets reflect light (not sources)

Reflection:
- Light bounces off shiny surfaces
- Mirrors reflect light
- Angles of incidence and reflection

Shadows:
- Formed when opaque object blocks light
- Shadow shape matches object
- Size depends on distance from light source
- Sun creates shadows at different positions throughout day

Danger:
- Never look directly at sun
- Can damage eyes permanently
