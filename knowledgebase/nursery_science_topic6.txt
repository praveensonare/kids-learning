TOPIC 6: Day and Night

Theory: Earth spins, giving us day and night. During the day it's light because we can see the sun. At night it's dark and we can see the moon and stars.

Day Time:
- Light outside because of the sun
- Sky is blue or cloudy
- We can see clearly
- Most people are awake
- Day activities: school, playing, eating lunch

Night Time:
- Dark outside, sun has gone down
- Sky is black, we see moon and stars
- Need lights to see inside
- Most people sleep
- Night activities: sleeping, bedtime story, dreaming

Worksheets:
