Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Living Things - Animals and Their Habitats
Theory: Animals are living things that need food, water, and shelter. Different animals live in different habitats that provide what they need to survive.

Animal Groups:
- Mammals: fur/hair, give birth to live babies, feed milk (cat, dog, rabbit, human, whale)
- Birds: feathers, wings, lay eggs, beak (robin, duck, penguin, eagle)
- Fish: scales, fins, gills, live in water (goldfish, shark, salmon)
- Reptiles: scales, lay eggs, cold-blooded (snake, lizard, turtle, crocodile)
- Amphibians: wet skin, start in water then land (frog, toad, newt)
- Insects: 6 legs, 3 body parts, most have wings (bee, ant, butterfly, ladybird)

Habitats:
- Woodland: trees, birds, squirrels, foxes, deer, owls
- Ocean: fish, whales, dolphins, crabs, starfish
- Pond: frogs, ducks, fish, dragonflies, water snails
- Desert: camels, snakes, lizards, scorpions (hot, dry, sandy)
- Arctic: polar bears, penguins, seals (cold, icy, snowy)
- Garden: birds, worms, slugs, bees, butterflies, hedgehogs

Worksheets:
1. Animal Groups: Sort animals into mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, insects
2. Habitat Match: Draw lines connecting animals to their homes
3. What Do I Need?: Match animals to their food, water, and shelter needs
4. Life Cycles: Order pictures showing butterfly life cycle (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly)

TOPIC 2: Plants and Growth
Theory: Plants are living things that grow from seeds. They need water, light, air, and nutrients from soil. Plants make their own food using sunlight.

Plant Life Cycle:
1. Seed: planted in soil
2. Germination: seed sprouts roots down, shoot up
3. Seedling: small plant grows
4. Adult plant: fully grown, makes flowers
5. Flowering: flowers attract bees
6. Fruit/seeds: new seeds form, spread, cycle repeats

What Plants Need:
- Water: to drink and stay alive
- Light: from sun to make food
- Air: to breathe
- Soil: for nutrients and to hold roots
- Space: to grow bigger
- Warmth: to grow well

Parts and Jobs:
- Roots: anchor plant, absorb water and nutrients
- Stem: support, transport water up
- Leaves: make food using sunlight (photosynthesis)
- Flowers: attract insects, make seeds
- Seeds: grow into new plants

Worksheets:
1. Plant Diary: Draw your bean plant each week as it grows
2. What's Missing?: Show plants with missing needs (no water/light) and predict what happens
3. Parts and Jobs: Match plant parts to their functions
4. Edible Plants: Sort foods by plant part (roots: carrot, leaves: lettuce, fruit: apple, seeds: peas)

TOPIC 3: Human Body and Health
Theory: Our bodies are amazing! Different body parts work together to help us move, think, eat, breathe, and stay healthy.

Body Systems (Simple):
- Skeleton: bones inside give body shape and protect organs
- Muscles: help us move, get stronger with exercise
- Heart: pumps blood around body (feel your pulse)
- Lungs: help us breathe air in and out
- Brain: controls everything, helps us think and remember
- Stomach: breaks down food we eat

Staying Healthy:
- Eat healthy foods: fruits, vegetables, proteins, grains, dairy
- Drink water: 6-8 glasses a day
- Exercise: run, jump, play sports, be active
- Sleep: 10-12 hours for children
- Wash hands: before eating, after toilet, after playing outside
- Brush teeth: twice a day, morning and night
- Visit doctor: for checkups and when sick

Five Senses Detailed:
- Sight (Eyes): See shapes, colors, near, far; protect with sunglasses
- Hearing (Ears): Hear loud, quiet, high, low sounds; protect from very loud noises
- Touch (Skin): Feel hot, cold, soft, hard, wet, dry, rough, smooth, pain
- Taste (Tongue): Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami; taste buds
- Smell (Nose): Pleasant, unpleasant, strong, weak scents

Worksheets:
1. Healthy Choices: Circle healthy foods, cross out unhealthy foods
2. Body Part Functions: Match body parts to what they do
3. Senses Investigation: Test mystery items using different senses
4. Exercise Log: Draw activities you did today that were exercise

TOPIC 4: Materials, Properties, and Changes
Theory: Materials are what objects are made from. They have different properties. Some materials can change when heated, cooled, or mixed.

Material Properties:
- Transparent: see through (glass, clear plastic, water)
- Opaque: cannot see through (wood, metal, thick paper)
- Flexible: bends easily (rubber, fabric, paper)
- Rigid: doesn't bend (wood, metal, hard plastic)
- Waterproof: water runs off (plastic, rubber, metal)
- Absorbent: soaks up water (sponge, paper towel, fabric)
- Magnetic: attracted to magnets (iron, steel, some metals)
- Non-magnetic: not attracted (wood, plastic, aluminum, copper)

Changing Materials:
- Melting: solid to liquid (ice → water, chocolate melts when warm)
- Freezing: liquid to solid (water → ice in freezer)
- Dissolving: solid disappears in liquid (sugar in tea, salt in water)
- Mixing: combine ingredients (flour + water = dough)
- Heating: changes food (raw egg → cooked egg, bread → toast)
- Evaporation: liquid to gas (puddle dries up, wet clothes dry)

Reversible vs Irreversible:
- Reversible: can change back (melt ice → freeze again, dissolve salt → evaporate water)
- Irreversible: cannot change back (bake cake, burn wood, cook egg)

Worksheets:
1. Property Testing: Test materials for waterproof, transparent, magnetic, flexible
2. Which Material?: Choose best material for umbrella, window, toy, spoon
3. Melting Investigation: Predict which materials melt (ice, chocolate, wax vs rock, wood, metal)
4. Dissolving Test: Which things dissolve in water? (sugar, salt vs sand, rice)

TOPIC 5: Seasons, Weather, and Climate
Theory: Earth's tilt and orbit around the sun create seasons. Weather is daily conditions. Climate is long-term weather patterns.

Detailed Seasons (UK):
Spring (March-May):
- Days get longer and warmer
- Flowers bloom (daffodils, tulips, bluebells)
- Baby animals born (lambs, chicks, calves)
- Trees grow new leaves
- Birds build nests

Summer (June-August):
- Longest days, most sunlight
- Warmest weather, hot and sunny
- Plants fully grown, fruits ripen
- Holidays, beach, swimming
- Light until late evening

Autumn/Fall (September-November):
- Days get shorter and cooler
- Leaves turn red, orange, yellow, brown
- Leaves fall from deciduous trees
- Harvest time (apples, pumpkins, vegetables)
- Animals prepare for winter (squirrels gather nuts)

Winter (December-February):
- Shortest days, least sunlight
- Coldest weather, may snow
- Some trees bare (no leaves)
- Some animals hibernate (hedgehogs, dormice)
- Christmas, warm clothes, hot drinks

Weather Measurements:
- Temperature: hot, warm, cool, cold (thermometer)
- Wind: still, breezy, windy, stormy (windsock, flags)
- Rain: dry, drizzle, showers, heavy rain (rain gauge)
- Sun: sunny, partly cloudy, cloudy, overcast
- Special: snow, hail, fog, frost, thunder, lightning

Worksheets:
1. Season Sort: Group pictures into the four seasons
2. Weather Journal: Record weather symbols daily for a month
3. Season Tree: Draw same tree in all four seasons
4. Weather Clothes: Match weather to appropriate clothing

TOPIC 6: Light and Dark
Theory: Light lets us see. It travels in straight lines from sources. Shadows form when light is blocked.

Light Sources:
- Natural: sun (biggest), stars, moon (reflects sunlight), fire, lightning
- Artificial: light bulbs, candles, torches, screens, glow sticks, lamps

Light Behaviors:
- Travels in straight lines: cannot bend around corners
- Reflects: bounces off shiny surfaces (mirrors, water, metal)
- Transparent materials: light passes through (glass, clear plastic, water)
- Translucent materials: some light passes through (tissue paper, frosted glass)
- Opaque materials: light blocked (wood, metal, thick fabric)

Shadows:
- Form when object blocks light
- Shadow on opposite side from light source
- Bigger shadow: light source closer or object bigger
- Smaller shadow: light source farther or object smaller
- No shadow without light

Day and Night:
- Earth spins (rotates) once every 24 hours
- Day: our side faces the sun (light)
- Night: our side faces away from sun (dark)
- Moon visible at night (reflects sun's light)
- Different times around the world

Worksheets:
1. Light Sources: Circle things that make light
2. Shadow Investigation: Draw shadows at different times of day
3. Transparent Test: Sort materials by how much light passes through
4. Safety: Never look directly at the sun - why?

TOPIC 7: Sound and Hearing
Theory: Sounds are made when things vibrate (move back and forth quickly). Sound travels through air to our ears.

How Sounds Are Made:
- Vibrations: guitar string, drum skin, vocal cords vibrate
- Louder: bigger vibrations (hit drum harder)
- Quieter: smaller vibrations (gentle tap)
- Higher pitch: faster vibrations (thin guitar string, small drum)
- Lower pitch: slower vibrations (thick string, big drum)

Types of Sounds:
- Musical: singing, instruments (piano, violin, flute, drums)
- Nature: birds chirping, wind blowing, rain falling, thunder
- Animals: dog bark, cat meow, lion roar, bee buzz
- Everyday: door slam, phone ring, car horn, footsteps
- Loud: drum, alarm, thunder, shout
- Quiet: whisper, tick-tock, rustling leaves

Hearing and Ears:
- Sound travels through air to ear
- Ear collects sounds, sends signals to brain
- Protect ears from very loud sounds
- Hearing helps us: communicate, enjoy music, stay safe (hear alarms)

Worksheets:
1. Sound Walk: List sounds you hear on a walk around school
2. Loud or Quiet?: Sort pictures of sound sources
3. Make Music: Draw instruments and describe their sounds
4. Vibration Experiment: Feel vibrations on drum, kazoo, your throat when humming
