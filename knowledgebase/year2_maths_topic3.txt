Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 3: Multiplication and Division

Theory: Multiplication is repeated addition. Division is sharing or grouping equally.

Times Tables (2, 5, 10):
- 2 times table: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24
- 5 times table: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60
- 10 times table: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120

Multiplication as Arrays:
- 3 × 4 = 3 rows of 4 = 12
- Commutative: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3

Division:
- Sharing: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (12 shared among 3 = 4 each)
- Grouping: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (how many groups of 3 in 12? 4 groups)
- Inverse of multiplication: If 3 × 4 = 12, then 12 ÷ 3 = 4

Word Problems:
- 5 boxes with 6 pencils each. Total? 5 × 6 = 30
- 20 sweets shared among 4 children. Each gets? 20 ÷ 4 = 5

1. Times Tables: Complete 2, 5, 10 times tables
2. Arrays: Draw arrays for multiplication facts
3. Division Pictures: Share objects equally
