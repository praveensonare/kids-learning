TOPIC 3: Grammar - Sentence Types and Tenses

Theory: Different sentence types serve different purposes. Verbs change form to show when something happened.

Sentence Types:
- Statement: tells information (The cat sat on the mat.)
- Question: asks something (Where is the cat?)
- Command: gives instruction (Sit down. Be quiet.)
- Exclamation: shows strong feeling (What a big cat!)

Punctuation:
- Full stop (.): end of statement
- Question mark (?): end of question
- Exclamation mark (!): end of exclamation or command showing excitement
- Comma (,): separate items in list (I bought apples, oranges, bananas and grapes.)
- Apostrophe ('): contraction (do not → don't, I am → I'm)

Present Tense vs Past Tense:
- Present: happening now (I walk, she runs, they play)
- Past: already happened (I walked, she ran, they played)
- Progressive: -ing shows ongoing (I am walking, she was running)

Regular vs Irregular Past Tense:
- Regular: add -ed (walk → walked, play → played)
- Irregular: changes completely (run → ran, go → went, see → saw, eat → ate)

Worksheets:
1. Sentence Types: Label each sentence as statement, question, command, or exclamation
2. Add Punctuation: Put correct punctuation at end of sentences
3. Tense Change: Rewrite sentences changing from present to past
4. Apostrophe Practice: Write contractions for word pairs (cannot → can't)
