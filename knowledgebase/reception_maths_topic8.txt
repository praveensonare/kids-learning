Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 8: Measurement - Length, Weight, Capacity

Theory: We can measure and compare objects using non-standard units (cubes, hands) and mathematical language.

Length Examples:
- The pencil is 8 cubes long
- The table is longer than the chair
- Measure your hand span in cubes

Weight Examples:
- The book is heavier than the pencil
- Balance scales show which is heavier/lighter

Capacity Examples:
- This jug is full of water
- The cup is half full
- Container A holds more than container B

Worksheets:
1. Measuring: Use cubes to measure objects in the classroom
2. Comparing: Circle the heavier object, underline the lighter
3. Capacity: Order containers from holds least to holds most
4. Practical Problems: "How many cups fill the jug?"
