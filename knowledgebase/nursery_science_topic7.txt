Nursery Science - Discovery and Exploration
TOPIC 7: Forces and Movement

Theory: Forces make things move, stop, or change direction. We use pushes and pulls every day.

Push and Pull:
- Push: move something away from you (push a swing, push a toy car, push a door open)
- Pull: move something toward you (pull a wagon, pull a drawer open, pull a rope)
- Both: opening a drawer (pull), closing it (push)

Types of Movement:
- Rolling: wheels, balls, cylinders roll
- Sliding: smooth surfaces let things slide
- Bouncing: balls bounce up and down
- Spinning: tops, wheels, merry-go-round spin round
- Floating: boats, ducks, leaves float on water
- Sinking: heavy things sink to the bottom

Fast and Slow:
- Car is fast, snail is slow
- Cheetah is fast, tortoise is slow
- Rocket is very fast, person walking is slow

Worksheets:
1. Push or Pull?: Circle if you push or pull to use each object
2. Ramp Races: Which toy car rolls fastest down a ramp?
3. Will It Roll?: Predict which shapes will roll (ball, cube, cylinder)
4. Fast or Slow?: Sort animals and vehicles by how fast they move
