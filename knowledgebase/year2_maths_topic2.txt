Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 2: Addition and Subtraction (2-digit numbers)

Theory: Mental and written methods help us calculate efficiently with larger numbers.

Mental Strategies:
- Count on/back in tens: 34 + 20 = 54
- Use number bonds: 27 + 3 = 30, then +17 = 47
- Partition: 45 + 23 = (40 + 20) + (5 + 3) = 68
- Near doubles: 6 + 7 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13

Column Addition (no carrying):
```
  34
+ 25
----
  59
```

Column Addition (with carrying):
```
  47
+ 38
----
  85  (7+8=15, carry 1)
```

Subtraction Methods:
- Count back: 45 - 3 = 42
- Find difference: Count up from smaller to larger
- Column subtraction

Word Problems:
- There are 45 children. 28 are girls. How many boys? (45 - 28 = 17)
- Shop has 36 apples, gets 47 more. Total? (36 + 47 = 83)
