Year 2 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum

Learning Objectives:
- Count, read, write numbers to 100, understanding place value
- Add and subtract 2-digit numbers
- Know 2, 5, 10 times tables
- Use and apply fractions
- Measure using standard units
- Identify and describe properties of 2D and 3D shapes
- Tell time to 5 minutes

Key Topics:

TOPIC 1: Place Value to 100
Theory: Understanding that the position of a digit determines its value is crucial for all mathematics.

Place Value Concepts:
- Tens and Ones: 45 = 4 tens (40) + 5 ones (5)
- Partitioning: Breaking numbers (67 = 60 + 7)
- Comparing: 56 > 43, 28 < 31
- Ordering: 12, 25, 34, 47, 89 (ascending)
- Estimating: About 50, nearly 100

Number Line Skills:
- Count in steps: 2s, 5s, 10s
- Find number between: What's between 34 and 36? (35)
- Round to nearest 10: 47 rounds to 50

Examples:
- 73 = 70 + 3 = 7 tens and 3 ones
- Compare: 45 < 54 (look at tens first)
- Round: 34 → 30, 36 → 40 (nearest 10)

Worksheets:
1. Place Value Grid: Write numbers in tens and ones
2. Partitioning: Break numbers in different ways (42 = 40 + 2 = 30 + 12)
3. Ordering: Arrange 6 numbers from smallest to largest
4. Estimating: Estimate positions on number line

TOPIC 2: Addition and Subtraction (2-digit numbers)
Theory: Mental and written methods help us calculate efficiently with larger numbers.

Mental Strategies:
- Count on/back in tens: 34 + 20 = 54
- Use number bonds: 27 + 3 = 30, then +17 = 47
- Partition: 45 + 23 = (40 + 20) + (5 + 3) = 68
- Near doubles: 6 + 7 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13

Column Addition (no carrying):
```
  34
+ 25
----
  59
```

Column Addition (with carrying):
```
  47
+ 38
----
  85  (7+8=15, carry 1)
```

Subtraction Methods:
- Count back: 45 - 3 = 42
- Find difference: Count up from smaller to larger
- Column subtraction

Word Problems:
- There are 45 children. 28 are girls. How many boys? (45 - 28 = 17)
- Shop has 36 apples, gets 47 more. Total? (36 + 47 = 83)

Worksheets:
1. Mental Addition: 50 quick addition facts
2. Column Method: 10 addition problems with carrying
3. Subtraction Practice: Mix of mental and written
4. Word Problems: 10 real-life addition/subtraction problems

TOPIC 3: Multiplication and Division
Theory: Multiplication is repeated addition. Division is sharing or grouping equally.

Times Tables (2, 5, 10):
- 2 times table: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24
- 5 times table: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60
- 10 times table: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120

Multiplication as Arrays:
- 3 × 4 = 3 rows of 4 = 12
- Commutative: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3

Division:
- Sharing: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (12 shared among 3 = 4 each)
- Grouping: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (how many groups of 3 in 12? 4 groups)
- Inverse of multiplication: If 3 × 4 = 12, then 12 ÷ 3 = 4

Word Problems:
- 5 boxes with 6 pencils each. Total? 5 × 6 = 30
- 20 sweets shared among 4 children. Each gets? 20 ÷ 4 = 5

Worksheets:
1. Times Tables: Complete 2, 5, 10 times tables
2. Arrays: Draw arrays for multiplication facts
3. Division Pictures: Share objects equally
4. Mixed Problems: Multiply and divide word problems

TOPIC 4: Fractions
Theory: Fractions represent equal parts of a whole or a group.

Unit Fractions:
- 1/2: one half (1 out of 2 equal parts)
- 1/3: one third (1 out of 3 equal parts)
- 1/4: one quarter (1 out of 4 equal parts)

Non-Unit Fractions:
- 2/4: two quarters (2 out of 4 equal parts)
- 3/4: three quarters (3 out of 4 equal parts)
- 2/3: two thirds (2 out of 3 equal parts)

Finding Fractions of Amounts:
- 1/2 of 12 = 6 (divide by 2)
- 1/4 of 20 = 5 (divide by 4)
- 3/4 of 20 = 15 (find 1/4 first, then ×3)

Equivalent Fractions:
- 1/2 = 2/4 (same amount)
- Two halves = one whole

Worksheets:
1. Shade Fractions: Color 1/3, 2/4, 3/4 of shapes
2. Fractions of Amounts: Find 1/2, 1/4, 1/3 of numbers
3. Equivalent Fractions: Match equal fractions
4. Compare Fractions: Which is bigger? 1/2 or 1/4?

TOPIC 5: Measurement
Theory: We use standard units to measure accurately and communicate measurements.

Length:
- Units: millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), meters (m)
- Tools: ruler, tape measure, meter stick
- 1 meter = 100 centimeters
- Examples: pencil = 15 cm, door = 2 m

Mass/Weight:
- Units: grams (g), kilograms (kg)
- Tools: scales, balance
- 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
- Examples: apple = 100g, bag of sugar = 1kg

Capacity:
- Units: milliliters (ml), liters (l)
- Tools: measuring jug, beaker
- 1 liter = 1000 milliliters
- Examples: spoon = 5ml, bottle = 500ml, bucket = 5l

Temperature:
- Units: degrees Celsius (°C)
- Tool: thermometer
- Examples: freezing = 0°C, body = 37°C, boiling = 100°C

Worksheets:
1. Measure Lines: Use ruler to measure in cm
2. Choose Units: What unit for measuring a car's length? (meters)
3. Reading Scales: Read measurements on scales
4. Estimation: Estimate then measure objects

TOPIC 6: Geometry - 2D and 3D Shapes
Theory: Shapes have specific properties that help us identify and classify them.

2D Shape Properties:
- Sides: straight edges
- Vertices: corners/points where sides meet
- Right angles: square corners (90°)
- Lines of symmetry: where shape can fold in half

Common 2D Shapes:
- Triangle: 3 sides, 3 vertices
- Quadrilaterals: 4 sides, 4 vertices
  * Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
  * Rectangle: opposite sides equal, 4 right angles
  * Rhombus: 4 equal sides, opposite angles equal
- Pentagon: 5 sides
- Hexagon: 6 sides
- Octagon: 8 sides
- Circle: curved edge, no vertices

3D Shape Properties:
- Faces: flat surfaces
- Edges: where two faces meet
- Vertices: points where edges meet

Common 3D Shapes:
- Cube: 6 square faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Cuboid: 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices
- Sphere: 1 curved surface
- Cylinder: 2 circular faces, 1 curved surface
- Cone: 1 circular face, 1 vertex
- Pyramid: triangular faces, 1 base

Worksheets:
1. Properties Table: List properties of shapes
2. Symmetry: Draw lines of symmetry on shapes
3. 3D Nets: Which nets fold to make cube?
4. Shape Hunt: Find and photograph shapes in school

TOPIC 7: Time
Theory: We measure time to organize our lives and understand duration.

Telling Time:
- O'clock: 3:00 (hour hand on 3, minute hand on 12)
- Half past: 3:30 (hour hand between 3 and 4, minute hand on 6)
- Quarter past: 3:15 (minute hand on 3)
- Quarter to: 2:45 (minute hand on 9, one before hour)
- 5-minute intervals: 3:05, 3:10, 3:15, etc.

Duration:
- Minutes in an hour: 60
- Hours in a day: 24
- Days in a week: 7
- Months in a year: 12
- Days in a year: 365 (366 leap year)

Time Calculations:
- Start 2:00, end 3:00 = 1 hour
- Start 3:15, end 3:45 = 30 minutes
- 2 hours after 10:00 = 12:00

Calendar:
- Days of week: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- Months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
- Yesterday, today, tomorrow
- Last week, this week, next week

Worksheets:
1. Draw Clock Hands: Show times to 5 minutes
2. Time Intervals: How long from 2:15 to 3:00?
3. Calendar Questions: What day is 3 days after Wednesday?
4. Daily Timeline: Draw your day showing times for activities

TOPIC 8: Statistics and Data
Theory: We collect, organize, and interpret data to answer questions.

Collecting Data:
- Tally marks: |||| (group of 5)
- Surveys: asking questions
- Observations: counting what we see

Displaying Data:
- Pictograms: pictures represent numbers
- Block graphs: blocks show frequency
- Tables: organize information in rows and columns

Reading Graphs:
- Title: What is the graph about?
- Axes: What do they show?
- Scale: How much does each symbol/block represent?
- Most/least: Which has most/least?
- Total: Add all amounts
- Difference: Compare amounts

Example: Favorite Fruits
| Fruit | Tally | Number |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Apple | |||   | 3      |
| Banana| ||||  | 5      |
| Orange| ||    | 2      |
