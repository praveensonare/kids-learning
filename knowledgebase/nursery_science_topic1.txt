- Farm animals: cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, horses
- Wild animals: lions, elephants, monkeys, bears
- Birds: sparrows, pigeons, ducks, owls
- Minibeasts: butterflies, ladybirds, worms, snails, ants

Animal Features:
- Dogs have 4 legs, fur, a tail, and bark
- Birds have 2 legs, feathers, wings, and lay eggs
- Fish have fins, scales, and live in water
- Insects have 6 legs and some can fly

Worksheets:
