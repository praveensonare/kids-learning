Nursery Literacy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 5: Pre-Writing Skills

Theory: Pre-writing activities develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination needed for writing. Children practice pencil grip, control, and basic shapes that form letters.

Pre-Writing Patterns:
- Vertical lines (down)
- Horizontal lines (across)
- Circles (round and round)
- Diagonal lines (slanting)
- Zigzags and waves

Examples:
- Draw rain (vertical lines down)
- Draw a road (horizontal line across)
- Draw balloons (circles)
- Draw a mountain (zigzag line)
- Trace dotted patterns

Worksheets:
1. Line Practice: Trace vertical and horizontal lines
2. Circle Time: Draw lots of bubbles (circles)
3. Pattern Complete: Continue the pattern (line, circle, line...)
4. Shape Drawing: Draw squares, triangles, circles
