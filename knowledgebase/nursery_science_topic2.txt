TOPIC 2: Living Things - Plants

Theory: Plants are living things that grow from seeds. They need water, light, and soil to grow. Plants give us food and make the air clean.

Parts of a Plant:
- Roots: underground, take in water and nutrients
- Stem: holds the plant up, carries water
- Leaves: green, make food for the plant, need sunlight
- Flowers: colorful, make seeds
- Seeds: grow into new plants

Examples:
- Trees: oak, apple, pine (tall plants with thick stems called trunks)
- Flowers: sunflower, rose, daisy, tulip
- Vegetables: carrot, potato, lettuce, tomato
- Fruits: apple, banana, orange, strawberry

Worksheets:
1. Label the Plant: Point to roots, stem, leaves, flower on a picture
2. Plant Needs: Circle what plants need to grow (water, light, soil vs. toys, TV)
3. Fruit or Vegetable?: Sort pictures into fruits and vegetables
4. Growing Sequence: Put pictures in order (seed → sprout → plant → flower)
