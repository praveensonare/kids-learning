Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 3: Comparing Numbers

Theory: We can compare numbers using the language: greater than, less than, equal to, more, fewer, same.

Examples:
- 15 is greater than 12
- 8 is less than 10
- 6 = 6 (equal, same amount)
- Compare groups: 7 apples > 5 oranges

Worksheets:
1. Circle the Greater: Compare pairs of numbers (13 vs 17)
2. Order Numbers: Arrange 5, 12, 8, 3 from smallest to biggest
3. More or Less: Use > < = symbols (with support)
4. Picture Problems: Which group has more? Count and compare
