Nursery Numeracy - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 8: Simple Addition (Combining Groups)

Theory: Addition means putting groups together to find how many altogether. At this age, we use objects and pictures to help us count the total.

Adding Concepts:
- Start with one group
- Add another group
- Count all together
- Use fingers, objects, or pictures to help

Examples:
- 2 red cars and 1 blue car = 3 cars altogether
- 3 apples and 2 more apples = 5 apples total
- Hold up 2 fingers, then 3 more fingers = 5 fingers
- "I have 1 cookie, you give me 2 more, now I have 3!"

Worksheets:
1. Count All: Draw 3 stars in one box, 2 stars in another, count total
2. Picture Addition: Circle both groups and write how many altogether
3. Finger Addition: Color fingers to show 2+3
4. Story Problems: "Tom has 2 toys, gets 1 more, how many now?"
