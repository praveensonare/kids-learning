Reception Science - Exploring the World Around Us
TOPIC 1: Living Things - Animals and Their Habitats

Theory: Animals are living things that need food, water, and shelter. Different animals live in different habitats that provide what they need to survive.

Animal Groups:
- Mammals: fur/hair, give birth to live babies, feed milk (cat, dog, rabbit, human, whale)
- Birds: feathers, wings, lay eggs, beak (robin, duck, penguin, eagle)
- Fish: scales, fins, gills, live in water (goldfish, shark, salmon)
- Reptiles: scales, lay eggs, cold-blooded (snake, lizard, turtle, crocodile)
- Amphibians: wet skin, start in water then land (frog, toad, newt)
- Insects: 6 legs, 3 body parts, most have wings (bee, ant, butterfly, ladybird)

Habitats:
- Woodland: trees, birds, squirrels, foxes, deer, owls
- Ocean: fish, whales, dolphins, crabs, starfish
- Pond: frogs, ducks, fish, dragonflies, water snails
- Desert: camels, snakes, lizards, scorpions (hot, dry, sandy)
- Arctic: polar bears, penguins, seals (cold, icy, snowy)
- Garden: birds, worms, slugs, bees, butterflies, hedgehogs

Worksheets:
1. Animal Groups: Sort animals into mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, insects
2. Habitat Match: Draw lines connecting animals to their homes
3. What Do I Need?: Match animals to their food, water, and shelter needs
4. Life Cycles: Order pictures showing butterfly life cycle (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly)
