- Alliteration: Repeated starting sounds (slippery, slimy snakes)
- Similes: Compare using "like" or "as" (as cold as ice, runs like the wind)
- Onomatopoeia: Sound words (crash, bang, sizzle, whoosh)
- Repetition: Repeating words/phrases for effect

Types of Poems:
- List poems: List of related things
- Acrostic: First letters spell a word
