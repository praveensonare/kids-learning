Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 6: Subtraction Within 10

Theory: Subtraction means taking away, finding the difference, or finding how many are left.

Examples:
- 7 - 2 = 5 (seven take away two leaves five)
- 10 - 4 = 6 (ten subtract four equals six)
- 8 - 0 = 8 (subtracting zero leaves the number unchanged)
- 5 - 5 = 0 (subtracting a number from itself gives zero)

Worksheets:
1. Cross Out: Cross out objects and count how many are left
2. Number Line Subtraction: Start at 9, jump back 4
3. Subtraction Stories: "There were 8 birds. 3 flew away. How many left?"
4. Fact Families: If 6 + 3 = 9, then 9 - 3 = 6
