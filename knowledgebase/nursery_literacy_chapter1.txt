Nursery Literacy - Chapter 1: Alphabet Adventure

TOPIC 1: Letter Recognition

Theory:
The alphabet has 26 letters. Each letter has two forms: uppercase (capital) and lowercase (small). Letters are the building blocks of words. Learning to recognize letters by their shape and name is the first step in reading and writing.

Uppercase letters are used at the beginning of sentences and for names. They are bigger and often have different shapes than lowercase letters. For example:
- A (uppercase) vs a (lowercase)
- B (uppercase) vs b (lowercase)
- G (uppercase) vs g (lowercase)

Examples:
Example 1: Letter A
- Uppercase A looks like a triangle with a line across
- Lowercase a looks like a circle with a stick
- Words starting with A: Apple, Ant, Astronaut
- The letter A makes the sound /a/ as in "apple"

Example 2: Letter B
- Uppercase B has two bumps on the right side
- Lowercase b has one bump on the bottom right
- Words starting with B: Ball, Butterfly, Banana
- The letter B makes the sound /b/ as in "ball"

Example 3: Letter C
- Uppercase C looks like a big curve or open circle
- Lowercase c is a smaller curve
- Words starting with C: Cat, Car, Cake
- The letter C makes the sound /c/ or /k/ as in "cat"

TOPIC 2: Letter Sounds

Theory:
Each letter has a sound. Learning letter sounds (phonics) helps us read words. When we see a letter, we say its sound. For example, the letter 'S' makes the /s/ sound like in "sun" or "snake".

Consonants are letters that are not vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels are special letters: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)

When we put sounds together, we make words:
- C + A + T = CAT /c/ /a/ /t/
- D + O + G = DOG /d/ /o/ /g/

Examples:
Example 1: Letter S Sound
- S makes the /s/ sound (like a snake hissing: sssss)
- Words: Sun, Snake, Sock, Smile
- Listen for /s/ at the start: "Sam saw a snake"
- Practice: Say /s/ then add other sounds: /s-a/ /s-i/ /s-o/

Example 2: Letter M Sound
- M makes the /m/ sound (lips together: mmmmm)
- Words: Mom, Milk, Moon, Mouse
- Listen for /m/ at the start: "Mom made muffins"
- Practice: Hum with lips closed to feel the /m/ sound

Example 3: Letter T Sound
- T makes the /t/ sound (tongue taps behind teeth)
- Words: Top, Toy, Tree, Tiger
- Listen for /t/ at the start: "Tom took ten toys"
- Practice: Say /t/ quickly: t-t-t-t-t

Interactive Worksheet:

TOPIC 3: Alphabet Song and Sequence

Theory:
The alphabet has a special order from A to Z. We can remember this order by singing the alphabet song. Knowing the alphabet order helps us find words in dictionaries, organize things, and understand that letters have a sequence.

The alphabet sequence:
A B C D E F G
H I J K L M N O P
Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Each letter has a place or position. A is first, B is second, C is third, and so on. This order never changes.

Examples:
Example 1: First Five Letters
- The first 5 letters are: A, B, C, D, E
- A comes before B
- B is between A and C
- C comes after B but before D
- Practice: Sing "A B C D E F G..."

Example 2: Missing Letters
- If we have A _ C, the missing letter is B
- If we have D E _, the next letter is F
- The letter before D is C
- The letter after E is F

Example 3: Alphabetical Order
- To put words in ABC order, look at first letter
- Apple comes before Ball (A before B)
- Cat comes after Ball (C after B)
- Practice: Arrange letters A, C, B in order → A, B, C
