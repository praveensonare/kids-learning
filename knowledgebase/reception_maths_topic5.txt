Reception Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 5: Addition Within 10

Theory: Addition means combining groups or adding more to a starting amount. We can use objects, pictures, or number lines to help us add.

Examples:
- 3 + 2 = 5 (three frogs plus two more frogs makes five frogs)
- 4 + 4 = 8 (double 4)
- 6 + 1 = 7 (six add one more)
- 0 + 5 = 5 (zero plus any number equals that number)

Worksheets:
1. Picture Addition: Count both groups and write the answer
2. Number Line Addition: Start at 4, jump forward 3, where do you land?
3. Addition Stories: "Sam has 3 cars. He gets 2 more. How many now?"
4. Missing Numbers: 5 + ___ = 8
