Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 6: Fractions - Halves and Quarters

Theory: Fractions represent parts of a whole or parts of a group. The whole must be divided into equal parts.

Halves (1/2):
- 1 whole divided into 2 equal parts
- 1/2 of 8 = 4
- Half of a shape or quantity

Quarters (1/4):
- 1 whole divided into 4 equal parts
- 1/4 of 8 = 2
- Quarter of a shape or quantity

Examples:
- Half of a pizza = 2 equal slices
- Half of 10 = 5
- Quarter of a square = 1 of 4 equal parts
- Quarter of 12 = 3

Worksheets:
1. Shade Halves: Color 1/2 of each shape
2. Find Halves: What is 1/2 of 16?
3. Quarters: Divide shapes into 4 equal parts
4. Fraction Problems: "I ate 1/4 of 8 cookies. How many did I eat?"
