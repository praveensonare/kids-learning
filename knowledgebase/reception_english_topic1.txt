Reception English - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Phonics (Phase 2-4)

Theory: Phonics is a method of teaching reading by linking sounds (phonemes) with letters or groups of letters (graphemes). By learning these relationships, children can decode unfamiliar words.

Phase 2 Sounds: s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d, g, o, c, k, ck, e, u, r, h, b, f, l
Phase 3 Sounds: j, v, w, x, y, z, qu, ch, sh, th, ng, ai, ee, igh, oa, oo, ar, or, ur, ow, oi, ear, air, ure, er
Phase 4: Blending adjacent consonants (CCVC and CVCC words)

Examples:
- CVC words: cat, dog, sun, pin, mop
- Blending: c-a-t = cat, sh-o-p = shop
- Segmenting: fish = f-i-sh
- Phase 4: cr-a-b = crab, t-e-n-t = tent

Worksheets:
1. Sound Buttons: Put dots under each sound in the word "ship" (sh-i-p = 3 sounds)
2. Blending Practice: Read these words: sat, pit, dog, run, hug
3. Word Building: Use letter cards to make: cat, can, man, pan
