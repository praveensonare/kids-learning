Reception Science - Exploring the World Around Us
TOPIC 7: Sound and Hearing

Theory: Sounds are made when things vibrate (move back and forth quickly). Sound travels through air to our ears.

How Sounds Are Made:
- Vibrations: guitar string, drum skin, vocal cords vibrate
- Louder: bigger vibrations (hit drum harder)
- Quieter: smaller vibrations (gentle tap)
- Higher pitch: faster vibrations (thin guitar string, small drum)
- Lower pitch: slower vibrations (thick string, big drum)

Types of Sounds:
- Musical: singing, instruments (piano, violin, flute, drums)
- Nature: birds chirping, wind blowing, rain falling, thunder
- Animals: dog bark, cat meow, lion roar, bee buzz
- Everyday: door slam, phone ring, car horn, footsteps
- Loud: drum, alarm, thunder, shout
- Quiet: whisper, tick-tock, rustling leaves

Hearing and Ears:
- Sound travels through air to ear
- Ear collects sounds, sends signals to brain
- Protect ears from very loud sounds
- Hearing helps us: communicate, enjoy music, stay safe (hear alarms)

Worksheets:
1. Sound Walk: List sounds you hear on a walk around school
2. Loud or Quiet?: Sort pictures of sound sources
3. Make Music: Draw instruments and describe their sounds
4. Vibration Experiment: Feel vibrations on drum, kazoo, your throat when humming
