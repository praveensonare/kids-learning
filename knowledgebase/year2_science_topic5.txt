TOPIC 5: Seasonal Changes

Theory: The four seasons have different weather, daylight hours, and effects on living things.

Detailed Season Observations:

Spring (March-May):
- Temperature: warmer, 8-15°C
- Daylight: increasing (12-16 hours)
- Weather: showers, some sunny days, warmer
- Plants: buds, blossoms, new leaves, flowers bloom
- Animals: baby animals born, birds nest, butterflies emerge
- Activities: plant seeds, spring clean, Easter

Summer (June-August):
- Temperature: warm to hot, 15-25°C
- Daylight: longest days (16-17 hours)
- Weather: sunny, occasional rain, warmest season
- Plants: full leaves, fruits ripen, flowers in full bloom
- Animals: young animals grow, lots of insects, birds feed young
- Activities: holidays, beach, outdoor games, summer sports

Autumn (September-November):

- Plants: deciduous trees bare, evergreens keep leaves, not much grows
- Animals: some hibernate, birds fluff feathers, difficult to find food
- Activities: Christmas, warm clothes, indoor activities

Worksheets:
1. Season Wheel: Divide into four, add features of each season
2. Monthly Records: Record weather, temperature, daylight hours each month
3. Tree Observation: Photo same tree each month, note changes
4. Season Sort: Group pictures into correct seasons
