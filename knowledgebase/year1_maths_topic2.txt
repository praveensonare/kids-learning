Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 2: Addition Within 20

Theory: Addition combines two or more numbers to find the total. We can use number bonds, number lines, or mental strategies.

Mental Strategies:
- Count on from the larger number: 12 + 3 = start at 12, count 13, 14, 15
- Use doubles: 6 + 6 = 12, so 6 + 7 = 13 (one more)
- Make 10 first: 8 + 5 = 8 + 2 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
- Number bonds to 10 and 20

Examples:
- 7 + 8 = 15
- 9 + 9 = 18
- 12 + 5 = 17
- 10 + 10 = 20

Worksheets:
1. Addition Facts: Complete addition grid (+ table to 20)
2. Missing Numbers: 12 + ___ = 19
3. Word Problems: "Anna has 8 apples. Ben gives her 5 more. How many now?"
4. Number Bonds: Show all pairs that make 15
