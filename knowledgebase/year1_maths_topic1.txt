Year 1 Maths - Cambridge Primary Curriculum
TOPIC 1: Number and Place Value to 100

Theory: Our number system is based on place value. Each digit has a value depending on its position. In the number 45, the 4 represents 4 tens (40) and the 5 represents 5 ones.

Counting:
- Count forwards and backwards to 100
- Count in steps of 1, 2, 5, and 10
- Identify one more and one less

Place Value:
- 23 = 2 tens and 3 ones = 20 + 3
- 50 = 5 tens and 0 ones
- 10 ones = 1 ten

Worksheets:
1. Place Value Chart: Write numbers in tens and ones columns
2. Partition Numbers: 47 = ___ tens + ___ ones
3. Number Lines: Fill in missing numbers 34, 35, ___, 37, ___
4. Comparing: Use > < = to compare numbers (45 ___ 54)
